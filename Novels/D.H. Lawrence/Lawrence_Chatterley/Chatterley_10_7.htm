 <p>&quot;It's quarter past seven,&quot; he said, &quot;you'll do it.&quot;
      He had changed his voice, seemed to feel her distance. As they turned the
      last bend in the riding towards the hazel wall and the gate, he blew out
      the light. &quot;We'll see from here,&quot; he said, taking her gently by
      the arm.</p>
      <p>But it was difficult, the earth under their feet was a mystery, but he
      felt his way by tread: he was used to it. At the gate he gave her his
      electric torch. &quot;It's a bit lighter in the park,&quot; he said;
      &quot;but take it for fear you get off th' path.&quot;</p>
      <p>It was true, there seemed a ghost-glimmer of greyness in the open space
      of the park. He suddenly drew her to him and whipped his hand under her
      dress again, feeling her warm body with his wet, chill hand.</p>
      <p>&quot;I could die for the touch of a woman like thee,&quot; he said in
      his throat. &quot;If tha' would stop another minute.&quot;</p>
      <p>She felt the sudden force of his wanting her again.</p>
      <p>&quot;No, I must run,&quot; she said, a little wildly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay,&quot; he replied, suddenly changed, letting her go.</p>
      <p>She turned away, and on the instant she turned back to him saying:
      &quot;Kiss me.&quot;</p>
      <p>He bent over her indistinguishable and kissed her on the left eye. She
      held her mouth and he softly kissed it, but at once drew away. He hated
      mouth kisses.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll come tomorrow,&quot; she said, drawing away; &quot;if I
      can,&quot; she added.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! not so late,&quot; he replied out of the darkness. Already
      she could not see him at all.</p>
      <p>&quot;Goodnight,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Goodnight, your Ladyship,&quot; his voice.</p>
      <p>She stopped and looked back into the wet dark. She could just see the
      bulk of him. &quot;Why did you say that?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he replied. &quot;Goodnight then, run!&quot;</p>
      <p>She plunged on in the dark-grey tangible night. She found the side-door
      open, and slipped into her room unseen. As she closed the door the gong
      sounded, but she would take her bath all the same--she must take her bath.
      &quot;But I won't be late any more,&quot; she said to herself; &quot;it's
      too annoying.&quot;</p>
      <p>The next day she did not go to the wood. She went instead with Clifford
      to Uthwaite. He could occasionally go out now in the car, and had got a
      strong young man as chauffeur, who could help him out of the car if need
      be. He particularly wanted to see his godfather, Leslie Winter, who lived
      at Shipley Hall, not far from Uthwaite. Winter was an elderly gentleman
      now, wealthy, one of the wealthy coal-owners who had had their hey-day in
      King Edward's time. King Edward had stayed more than once at Shipley, for
      the shooting. It was a handsome old stucco hall, very elegantly appointed,
      for Winter was a bachelor and prided himself on his style; but the place
      was beset by collieries. Leslie Winter was attached to Clifford, but
      personally did not entertain a great respect for him, because of the
      photographs in illustrated papers and the literature. The old man was a
      buck of the King Edward school, who thought life was life and the
      scribbling fellows were something else. Towards Connie the Squire was
      always rather gallant; he thought her an attractive demure maiden and
      rather wasted on Clifford, and it was a thousand pities she stood no
      chance of bringing forth an heir to Wragby. He himself had no heir.</p>
      <p>Connie wondered what he would say if he knew that Clifford's
      game-keeper had been having intercourse with her, and saying to her &quot;tha'
      mun come to th' cottage one time.&quot; He would detest and despise her,
      for he had come almost to hate the shoving forward of the working classes.
      A man of her own class he would not mind, for Connie was gifted from
      nature with this appearance of demure, submissive maidenliness, and
      perhaps it was part of her nature. Winter called her &quot;dear
      child&quot; and gave her a rather lovely miniature of an
      eighteenth-century lady, rather against her will.</p>
      <p>But Connie was preoccupied with her affair with the keeper. After all,
      Mr. Winter, who was really a gentleman and a man of the world, treated her
      as a person and a discriminating individual; he did not lump her together
      with all the rest of his female womanhood in his &quot;thee&quot; and
      &quot;tha&quot;.</p>
      <p>She did not go to the wood that day nor the next, nor the day
      following. She did not go so long as she felt, or imagined she felt, the
      man waiting for her, wanting her. But the fourth day she was terribly
      unsettled and uneasy. She still refused to go to the wood and open her
      thighs once more to the man. She thought of all the things she might
      do--drive to Sheffield, pay visits, and the thought of all these things
      was repellent. At last she decided to take a walk, not towards the wood,
      but in the opposite direction; she would go to Marehay, through the little
      iron gate in the other side of the park fence. It was a quiet grey day of
      spring, almost warm. She walked on unheeding, absorbed in thoughts she was
      not even conscious of She was not really aware of anything outside her,
      till she was startled by the loud barking of the dog at Marehay Farm.
      Marehay Farm! Its pastures ran up to Wragby park fence, so they were
      neighbours, but it was some time since Connie had called.</p>
      <p>&quot;Bell!&quot; she said to the big white bull-terrier. &quot;Bell!
      have you forgotten me? Don't you know me?&quot; She was afraid of dogs,
      and Bell stood back and bellowed, and she wanted to pass through the
      farmyard on to the warren path.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Flint appeared. She was a woman of Constance's own age, had been a
      school-teacher, but Connie suspected her of being rather a false little
      thing.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, it's Lady Chatterley! Why!&quot; And Mrs. Flint's eyes
      glowed again, and she flushed like a young girl. &quot;Bell, Bell. Why!
      barking at Lady Chatterley! Bell! Be quiet!&quot; She darted forward and
      slashed at the dog with a white cloth she held in her hand, then came
      forward to Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;She used to know me,&quot; said Connie, shaking hands. The Flints
      were Chatterley tenants.</p>
      <p>&quot;Of course she knows your Ladyship! She's just showing off,&quot;
      said Mrs. Flint, glowing and looking up with a sort of flushed confusion,
      &quot;but it's so long since she's seen you. I do hope you are
      better.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes thanks, I'm all right.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;We've hardly seen you all winter. Will you come in and look at
      the baby?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well!&quot; Connie hesitated. &quot;Just for a minute.&quot;</p>
      <p>Mrs. Flint flew wildly in to tidy up, and Connie came slowly after her,
      hesitating in the rather dark kitchen where the kettle was boiling by the
      fire. Back came Mrs. Flint.</p>
      <p>&quot;I do hope you'll excuse me,&quot; she said. &quot;Will you come
      in here?&quot;</p>
