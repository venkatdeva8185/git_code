 <p>He was temporizing with life. He had thought he would be safe, at least
      for a time, in this wood. There was no shooting as yet: he had to rear the
      pheasants. He would have no guns to serve. He would be alone, and apart
      from life, which was all he wanted. He had to have some sort of a
      background. And this was his native place. There was even his mother,
      though she had never meant very much to him. And he could go on in life,
      existing from day to day, without connection and without hope. For he did
      not know what to do with himself.</p>
      <p>He did not know what to do with himself. Since he had been an officer
      for some years, and had mixed among the other officers and civil servants,
      with their wives and families, he had lost all ambition to `get on'. There
      was a toughness, a curious rubbernecked toughness and unlivingness about
      the middle and upper classes, as he had known them, which just left him
      feeling cold and different from them.</p>
      <p>So, he had come back to his own class. To find there, what he had
      forgotten during his absence of years, a pettiness and a vulgarity of
      manner extremely distasteful. He admitted now at last, how important
      manner was. He admitted, also, how important it was even <i>to pretend</i>
      not to care about the halfpence and the small things of life. But among
      the common people there was no pretence. A penny more or less on the bacon
      was worse than a change in the Gospel. He could not stand it.</p>
      <p>And again, there was the wage-squabble. Having lived among the owning
      classes, he knew the utter futility of expecting any solution of the
      wage-squabble. There was no solution, short of death. The only thing was
      not to care, not to care about the wages.</p>
      <p>Yet, if you were poor and wretched you <i>had</i> to care. Anyhow, it
      was becoming the only thing they did care about. The <i>care</i> about
      money was like a great cancer, eating away the individuals of all classes.
      He refused to <i>care</i> about money.</p>
      <p>And what then? What did life offer apart from the care of money?
      Nothing.</p>
      <p>Yet he could live alone, in the wan satisfaction of being alone, and
      raise pheasants to be shot ultimately by fat men after breakfast. It was
      futility, futility to the <i>nth</i> power.</p>
      <p>But why care, why bother? And he had not cared nor bothered till now,
      when this woman had come into his life. He was nearly ten years older than
      she. And he was a thousand years older in experience, starting from the
      bottom. The connection between them was growing closer. He could see the
      day when it would clinch up and they would have to make a life together.
      &quot;For the bonds of love are ill to loose!&quot;</p>
      <p>And what then? What then? Must he start again, with nothing to start
      on? Must he entangle this woman? Must he have the horrible broil with her
      lame husband? And also some sort of horrible broil with his own brutal
      wife, who hated him? Misery! Lots of misery! And he was no longer young
      and merely buoyant. Neither was he the insouciant sort. Every bitterness
      and every ugliness would hurt him: and the woman!</p>
      <p>But even if they got clear of Sir Clifford and of his own wife, even if
      they got clear, what were they going to do? What was he, himself going to
      do? What was he going to do with his life? For he must do something. He
      couldn't be a mere hanger-on, on her money and his own very small pension.</p>
      <p>It was the insoluble. He could only think of going to America, to try a
      new air. He disbelieved in the dollar utterly. But perhaps, perhaps there
      was something else.</p>
      <p>He could not rest nor even go to bed. After sitting in a stupor of
      bitter thoughts until midnight, he got suddenly from his chair and reached
      for his coat and gun.</p>
      <p>&quot;Come on, lass,&quot; he said to the dog. &quot;We're best
      outside.&quot;</p>
      <p>It was a starry night, but moonless. He went on a slow, scrupulous,
      soft-stepping and stealthy round. The only thing he had to contend with
      was the colliers setting snares for rabbits, particularly the Stacks Gate
      colliers, on the Marehay side. But it was breeding season, and even
      colliers respected it a little. Nevertheless the stealthy beating of the
      round in search of poachers soothed his nerves and took his mind off his
      thoughts.</p>
      <p>But when he had done his slow, cautious beating of his bounds---it was
      nearly a five-mile walk---he was tired. He went to the top of the knoll
      and looked out. There was no sound save the noise, the faint shuffling
      noise from Stacks Gate colliery, that never ceased working: and there were
      hardly any lights, save the brilliant electric rows at the works. The
      world lay darkly and fumily sleeping. It was half past two. But even in
      its sleep it was an uneasy, cruel world, stirring with the noise of a
      train or some great lorry on the road, and flashing with some rosy
      lightning flash from the furnaces. It was a world of iron and coal, the
      cruelty of iron and the smoke of coal, and the endless, endless greed that
      drove it all. Only greed, greed stirring in its sleep.</p>
      <p>It was cold, and he was coughing. A fine cold draught blew over the
      knoll. He thought of the woman. Now he would have given all he had or ever
      might have to hold her warm in his arms, both of them wrapped in one
      blanket, and sleep. All hopes of eternity and all gain from the past he
      would have given to have her there, to be wrapped warm with him in one
      blanket, and sleep, only sleep. It seemed the sleep with the woman in his
      arms was the only necessity.</p>
      <p>He went to the hut, and wrapped himself in the blanket and lay on the
      floor to sleep. But he could not, he was cold. And besides, he felt
      cruelly his own unfinished nature. He felt his own unfinished condition of
      aloneness cruelly. He wanted her, to touch her, to hold her fast against
      him in one moment of completeness and sleep.</p>
      <p>He got up again and went out, towards the park gates this time: then
      slowly along the path towards the house. It was nearly four o'clock, still
      clear and cold, but no sign of dawn. He was used to the dark, he could see
      well.</p>
      <p>Slowly, slowly the great house drew him, as a magnet. He wanted to be
      near her. It was not desire, not that. It was the cruel sense of
      unfinished aloneness, that needed a silent woman folded in his arms.
      Perhaps he could find her. Perhaps he could even call her out to him: or
      find some way in to her. For the need was imperious.</p>
      <p>He slowly, silently climbed the incline to the hall. Then he came round
      the great trees at the top of the knoll, on to the drive, which made a
      grand sweep round a lozenge of grass in front of the entrance. He could
      already see the two magnificent beeches which stood in this big level
      lozenge in front of the house, detaching themselves darkly in the dark
      air.</p>
      <p>There was the house, low and long and obscure, with one light burning
      downstairs, in Sir Clifford's room. But which room she was in, the woman
      who held the other end of the frail thread which drew him so mercilessly,
      that he did not know.</p>
