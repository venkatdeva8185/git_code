 <p>The grin flickered on Mellors' face.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, Sir, and what about her?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You've got a baby in her all right.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I have that honour!&quot; grinned Mellors.</p>
      <p>&quot;Honour, by God!' Sir Malcolm gave a little squirting laugh, and
      became Scotch and lewd. &quot;Honour! How was the going, eh? Good, my boy,
      what?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Good!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll bet it was! Ha-ha! My daughter, chip of the old block, what!
      I never went back on a good bit of fucking, myself. Though her mother, oh,
      holy saints!' He rolled his eyes to heaven. &quot;But you warmed her up,
      oh, you warmed her up, I can see that. Ha-ha! My blood in her! You set
      fire to her haystack all right. Ha-ha-ha! I was jolly glad of it, I can
      tell you. She needed it. Oh, she's a nice girl, she's a nice girl, and I
      knew she'd be good going, if only some damned man would set her stack on
      fire! Ha-ha-ha! A game-keeper, eh, my boy! Bloody good poacher, if you ask
      me. Ha-ha! But now, look here, speaking seriously, what are we going to do
      about it? Speaking seriously, you know!&quot;</p>
      <p>Speaking seriously, they didn't get very far. Mellors, though a little
      tipsy, was much the soberer of the two. He kept the conversation as
      intelligent as possible: which isn't saying much.</p>
      <p>&quot;So you're a game-keeper! Oh, you're quite right! That sort of
      game is worth a man's while, eh, what? The test of a woman is when you
      pinch her bottom. You can tell just by the feel of her bottom if she's
      going to come up all right. Ha-ha! I envy you, my boy. How old are
      you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Thirty-nine.&quot;</p>
      <p>The knight lifted his eyebrows.</p>
      <p>&quot;As much as that! Well, you've another good twenty years, by the
      look of you. Oh, game-keeper or not, you're a good cock. I can see that
      with one eye shut. Not like that blasted Clifford! A lily-livered hound
      with never a fuck in him, never had. I like you, my boy, I'll bet you've a
      good cod on you; oh, you're a bantam, I can see that. You're a fighter.
      Game-keeper! Ha-ha, by crikey, I wouldn't trust my game to you! But look
      here, seriously, what are we going to do about it? The world's full of
      blasted old women.&quot;</p>
      <p>Seriously, they didn't do anything about it, except establish the old
      free-masonry of male sensuality between them.</p>
      <p>&quot;And look here, my boy, if ever I can do anything for you, you can
      rely on me. Game-keeper! Christ, but it's rich! I like it! Oh, I like it!
      Shows the girl's got spunk. What? After all, you know, she has her own
      income, moderate, moderate, but above starvation. And I'll leave her what
      I've got. By God, I will. She deserves it for showing spunk, in a world of
      old women. I've been struggling to get myself clear of the skirts of old
      women for seventy years, and haven't managed it yet. But you're the man, I
      can see that.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm glad you think so. They usually tell me, in a sideways
      fashion, that I'm the monkey.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, they would! My dear fellow, what could you be but a monkey,
      to all the old women?&quot;</p>
      <p>They parted most genially, and Mellors laughed inwardly all the time
      for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>The following day he had lunch with Connie and Hilda, at some discreet
      place.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's a very great pity it's such an ugly situation all
      round,&quot; said Hilda.</p>
      <p>&quot;I had a lot o' fun out of it,&quot; said he.</p>
      <p>&quot;I think you might have avoided putting children into the world
      until you were both free to marry and have children.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The Lord blew a bit too soon on the spark,&quot; said he.</p>
      <p>&quot;I think the Lord had nothing to do with it. Of course, Connie has
      enough money to keep you both, but the situation is unbearable.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But then you don't have to bear more than a small corner of it,
      do you?&quot; said he.</p>
      <p>&quot;If you'd been in her own class.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Or if I'd been in a cage at the Zoo.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was silence.</p>
      <p>&quot;I think,&quot; said Hilda, &quot;it will be best if she names
      quite another man as co-respondent and you stay out of it
      altogether.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But I thought I'd put my foot right in.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I mean in the divorce proceedings.&quot;</p>
      <p>He gazed at her in wonder. Connie had not dared mention the Duncan
      scheme to him.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't follow,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;We have a friend who would probably agree to be named as
      co-respondent, so that your name need not appear,&quot; said Hilda.</p>
      <p>&quot;You mean a man?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Of course!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But she's got no other?&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked in wonder at Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;No, no!&quot; she said hastily. &quot;Only that old friendship,
      quite simple, no love.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Then why should the fellow take the blame? If he's had nothing
      out of you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Some men are chivalrous and don't only count what they get out of
      a woman,&quot; said Hilda.</p>
      <p>&quot;One for me, eh? But who's the johnny?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;A friend whom we've known since we were children in Scotland, an
      artist.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Duncan Forbes!' he said at once, for Connie had talked to him.
      &quot;And how would you shift the blame on to him?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;They could stay together in some hotel, or she could even stay in
      his apartment.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Seems to me like a lot of fuss for nothing,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;What else do you suggest?&quot; said Hilda. &quot;If your name
      appears, you will get no divorce from your wife, who is apparently quite
      an impossible person to be mixed up with.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;All that!&quot; he said grimly.</p>
      <p>There was a long silence.</p>
      <p>&quot;We could go right away,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;There is no right away for Connie,&quot; said Hilda.
      &quot;Clifford is too well known.&quot;</p>
      <p>Again the silence of pure frustration.</p>
      <p>&quot;The world is what it is. If you want to live together without
      being persecuted, you will have to marry. To marry, you both have to be
      divorced. So how are you both going about it?&quot;</p>
      <p>He was silent for a long time.</p>
      <p>&quot;How are you going about it for us?&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;We will see if Duncan will consent to figure as co-respondent:
      then we must get Clifford to divorce Connie: and you must go on with your
      divorce, and you must both keep apart till you are free.&quot;</p>
