 <p>The man looked down the front of his slender white body, and laughed.
      Between the slim breasts the hair was dark, almost black. But at the root
      of the belly, where the phallos rose thick and arching, it was gold-red,
      vivid in a little cloud.</p>
      <p>&quot;So proud!&quot; she murmured, uneasy. &quot;And so lordly! Now I
      know why men are so overbearing! But he's lovely, <i>really</i>. Like
      another being! A bit terrifying! But lovely really! And he comes to <i>me</i>!---&quot;
      She caught her lower lip between her teeth, in fear and excitement.</p>
      <p>The man looked down in silence at the tense phallos, that did not
      change.---&quot;Ay!&quot; he said at last, in a little voice. &quot;Ay ma
      lad! tha're theer right enough. Yi, tha mun rear thy head! Theer on thy
      own, eh? an' ta'es no count O' nob'dy! Tha ma'es nowt O' me, John Thomas.
      Art boss? of me? Eh well, tha're more cocky than me, an' tha says less.
      John Thomas! Dost want <i>her</i>? Dost want my lady Jane? Tha's dipped me
      in again, tha hast. Ay, an' tha comes up smilin'.---Ax 'er then! Ax lady
      Jane! Say: Lift up your heads, O ye gates, that the king of glory may come
      in. Ay, th' cheek on thee! Cunt, that's what tha're after. Tell lady Jane
      tha wants cunt. John Thomas, an' th' cunt O' lady Jane!---&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, don't tease him,&quot; said Connie, crawling on her knees on
      the bed towards him and putting her arms round his white slender loins,
      and drawing him to her so that her hanging, swinging breasts touched the
      tip of the stirring, erect phallos, and caught the drop of moisture. She
      held the man fast.</p>
      <p>&quot;Lie down!&quot; he said. &quot;Lie down! Let me come!&quot; He
      was in a hurry now.</p>
      <p>And afterwards, when they had been quite still, the woman had to
      uncover the man again, to look at the mystery of the phallos.</p>
      <p>&quot;And now he's tiny, and soft like a little bud of life!&quot; she
      said, taking the soft small penis in her hand. &quot;Isn't he somehow
      lovely! so on his own, so strange! And so innocent! And he comes so far
      into me! You must <i>never</i> insult him, you know. He's mine too. He's
      not only yours. He's mine! And so lovely and innocent!' And she held the
      penis soft in her hand.</p>
      <p>He laughed.</p>
      <p>&quot;Blest be the tie that binds our hearts in kindred love,&quot; he
      said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Of course!&quot; she said. &quot;Even when he's soft and little I
      feel my heart simply tied to him. And how lovely your hair is here! quite,
      quite different!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;That's John Thomas's hair, not mine!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;John Thomas! John Thomas!&quot; and she quickly kissed the soft
      penis, that was beginning to stir again.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; said the man, stretching his body almost painfully.
      &quot;He's got his root in my soul, has that gentleman! An' sometimes I
      don' know what ter do wi' him. Ay, he's got a will of his own, an' it's
      hard to suit him. Yet I wouldn't have him killed.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No wonder men have always been afraid of him!&quot; she said.
      &quot;He's rather terrible.&quot;</p>
      <p>The quiver was going through the man's body, as the stream of
      consciousness again changed its direction, turning downwards. And he was
      helpless, as the penis in slow soft undulations filled and surged and rose
      up, and grew hard, standing there hard and overweening, in its curious
      towering fashion. The woman too trembled a little as she watched.</p>
      <p>&quot;There! Take him then! He's thine,'&quot; said the man.</p>
      <p>And she quivered, and her own mind melted out. Sharp soft waves of
      unspeakable pleasure washed over her as he entered her, and started the
      curious molten thrilling that spread and spread till she was carried away
      with the last, blind flush of extremity.</p>
      <p>He heard the distant hooters of Stacks Gate for seven o'clock. It was
      Monday morning. He shivered a little, and with his face between her
      breasts pressed her soft breasts up over his ears, to deafen him.</p>
      <p>She had not even heard the hooters. She lay perfectly still, her soul
      washed transparent.</p>
      <p>&quot;You must get up, mustn't you?&quot; he muttered.</p>
      <p>&quot;What time?&quot; came her colourless voice.</p>
      <p>&quot;Seven-o'clock blowers a bit sin'.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I suppose I must.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was resenting as she always did, the compulsion from outside.</p>
      <p>He sat up and looked blankly out of the window. `You do love me, don't
      you?' she asked calmly. He looked down at her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Tha knows what tha knows. What dost ax for!&quot; he said, a
      little fretfully.</p>
      <p>&quot;I want you to keep me, not to let me go,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>His eyes seemed full of a warm, soft darkness that could not think.</p>
      <p>&quot;When? Now?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Now in your heart. Then I want to come and live with you, always,
      soon.&quot;</p>
      <p>He sat naked on the bed, with his head dropped, unable to think.</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't you want it?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>Then with the same eyes darkened with another flame of consciousness,
      almost like sleep, he looked at her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Dunna ax me nowt now,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me be. I like
      thee. I luv thee when tha lies theer. A woman's a lovely thing when 'er's
      deep ter fuck, and cunt's good. Ah luv thee, thy legs, an' th' shape on
      thee, an' th' womanness on thee. Ah luv th' womanness on thee. Ah luv thee
      wi' my bas an' wi' my heart. But dunna ax me nowt. Dunna ma'e me say nowt.
      Let me stop as I am while I can. Tha can ax me iverything after. Now let
      me be, let me be!&quot;</p>
      <p>And softly, he laid his hand over her mound of Venus, on the soft brown
      maiden-hair, and himself-sat still and naked on the bed, his face
      motionless in physical abstraction, almost like the face of Buddha.
      Motionless, and in the invisible flame of another consciousness, he sat
      with his hand on her, and waited for the turn.</p>
      <p>After a while, he reached for his shirt and put it on, dressed himself
      swiftly in silence, looked at her once as she still lay naked and faintly
      golden like a Gloire de Dijon rose on the bed, and was gone. She heard him
      downstairs opening the door.</p>
      <p>And still she lay musing, musing. It was very hard to go: to go out of
      his arms. He called from the foot of the stairs: `Half past seven!' She
      sighed, and got out of bed. The bare little room! Nothing in it at all but
      the small chest of drawers and the smallish bed. But the board floor was
      scrubbed clean. And in the corner by the window gable was a shelf with
      some books, and some from a circulating library. She looked. There were
      books about Bolshevist Russia, books of travel, a volume about the atom
      and the electron, another about the composition of the earth's core, and
      the causes of earthquakes: then a few novels: then three books on India.
      So! He was a reader after all.</p>
      <p>The sun fell on her naked limbs through the gable window. Outside she
      saw the dog Flossie roaming round. The hazel-brake was misted with green,
      and dark-green dogs-mercury under. It was a clear clean morning with birds
      flying and triumphantly singing. If only she could stay! If only there
      weren't the other ghastly world of smoke and iron! If only <i>he</i> would
      make her a world.</p>
      <p>She came downstairs, down the steep, narrow wooden stairs. Still she
      would be content with this little house, if only it were in a world of its
      own.</p>
      <p>He was washed and fresh, and the fire was burning. &quot;Will you eat
      anything?&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! Only lend me a comb.&quot;</p>
      <p>She followed him into the scullery, and combed her hair before the
      handbreadth of mirror by the back door. Then she was ready to go.</p>
      <p>She stood in the little front garden, looking at the dewy flowers, the
      grey bed of pinks in bud already.</p>
      <p>&quot;I would like to have all the rest of the world disappear,&quot;
      she said, &quot;and live with you here.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;It won't disappear,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>They went almost in silence through the lovely dewy wood. But they were
      together in a world of their own.</p>
      <p>It was bitter to her to go on to Wragby.</p>
      <p>&quot;I want soon to come and live with you altogether,&quot; she said
      as she left him.</p>
      <p>He smiled, unanswering.</p>
      <p>She got home quietly and unremarked, and went up to her room.</p>
