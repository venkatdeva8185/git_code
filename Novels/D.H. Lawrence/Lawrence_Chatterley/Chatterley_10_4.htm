 <p>&quot;Shall I come again?&quot; she asked wistfully.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! Yes!&quot;</p>
      <p>She left him and went across the park.</p>
      <p>He stood back and watched her going into the dark, against the pallor
      of the horizon. Almost with bitterness he watched her go. She had
      connected him up again, when he had wanted to be alone. She had cost him
      that bitter privacy of a man who at last wants only to be alone.</p>
      <p>He turned into the dark of the wood. All was still, the moon had set.
      But he was aware of the noises of the night, the engines at Stacks Gate,
      the traffic on the main road. Slowly he climbed the denuded knoll. And
      from the top he could see the country, bright rows of lights at Stacks
      Gate, smaller lights at Tevershall pit, the yellow lights of Tevershall
      and lights everywhere, here and there, on the dark country, with the
      distant blush of furnaces, faint and rosy, since the night was clear, the
      rosiness of the outpouring of white-hot metal. Sharp, wicked electric
      lights at Stacks Gate! An undefinable quick of evil in them! And all the
      unease, the ever-shifting dread of the industrial night in the Midlands.
      He could hear the winding-engines at Stacks Gate turning down the
      seven-o'clock miners. The pit worked three shifts.</p>
      <p>He went down again into the darkness and seclusion of the wood. But he
      knew that the seclusion of the wood was illusory. The industrial noises
      broke the solitude, the sharp lights, though unseen, mocked it. A man
      could no longer be private and withdrawn. The world allows no hermits. And
      now he had taken the woman, and brought on himself a new cycle of pain and
      doom. For he knew by experience what it meant.</p>
      <p>It was not woman's fault, nor even love's fault, nor the fault of sex.
      The fault lay there, out there, in those evil electric lights and
      diabolical rattlings of engines. There, in the world of the mechanical
      greedy, greedy mechanism and mechanized greed, sparkling with lights and
      gushing hot metal and roaring with traffic, there lay the vast evil thing,
      ready to destroy whatever did not conform. Soon it would destroy the wood,
      and the bluebells would spring no more. All vulnerable things must perish
      under the rolling and running of iron.</p>
      <p>He thought with infinite tenderness of the woman. Poor forlorn thing,
      she was nicer than she knew, and oh! so much too nice for the tough lot
      she was in contact with. Poor thing, she too had some of the vulnerability
      of the wild hyacinths, she wasn't all tough rubber-goods and platinum,
      like the modern girl. And they would do her in! As sure as life, they
      would do her in, as they do in all naturally tender life. Tender!
      Somewhere she was tender, tender with a tenderness of the growing
      hyacinths, something that has gone out of the celluloid women of today.
      But he would protect her with his heart for a little while. For a little
      while, before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed
      did them both in, her as well as him.</p>
      <p>He went home with his gun and his dog, to the dark cottage, lit the
      lamp, started the fire, and ate his supper of bread and cheese, young
      onions and beer. He was alone, in a silence he loved. His room was clean
      and tidy, but rather stark. Yet the fire was bright, the hearth white, the
      petroleum lamp hung bright over the table, with its white oil-cloth. He
      tried to read a book about India, but tonight he could not read. He sat by
      the fire in his shirt-sleeves, not smoking, but with a mug of beer in
      reach. And he thought about Connie.</p>
      <p>To tell the truth, he was sorry for what had happened, perhaps most for
      her sake. He had a sense of foreboding. No sense of wrong or sin; he was
      troubled by no conscience in that respect. He knew that conscience was
      chiefly tear of society, or fear of oneself. He was not afraid of himself.
      But he was quite consciously afraid of society, which he knew by instinct
      to be a malevolent, partly-insane beast.</p>
      <p>The woman! If she could be there with him, arid there were nobody else
      in the world! The desire rose again, his penis began to stir like a live
      bird. At the same time an oppression, a dread of exposing himself and her
      to that outside Thing that sparkled viciously in the electric lights,
      weighed down his shoulders. She, poor young thing, was just a young female
      creature to him; but a young female creature whom he had gone into and
      whom he desired again.</p>
      <p>Stretching with the curious yawn of desire, for he had been alone and
      apart from man or woman for four years, he rose and took his coat again,
      and his gun, lowered the lamp and went out into the starry night, with the
      dog. Driven by desire and by dread of the malevolent Thing outside, he
      made his round in the wood, slowly, softly. He loved the darkness arid
      folded himself into it. It fitted the turgidity of his desire which, in
      spite of all, was like a riches; the stirring restlessness of his penis,
      the stirring fire in his loins! Oh, if only there were other men to be
      with, to fight that sparkling electric Thing outside there, to preserve
      the tenderness of life, the tenderness of women, and the natural riches of
      desire. If only there were men to fight side by side with! But the men
      were all outside there, glorying in the Thing, triumphing or being trodden
      down in the rush of mechanized greed or of greedy mechanism.</p>
      <p>Constance, for her part, had hurried across the park, home, almost
      without thinking. As yet she had no afterthought. She would be in time for
      dinner.</p>
      <p>She was annoyed to find the doors fastened, however, so that she had to
      ring. Mrs. Bolton opened.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why there you are, your Ladyship! I was beginning to wonder if
      you'd gone lost!&quot; she said a little roguishly. &quot;Sir Clifford
      hasn't asked for you, though; he's got Mr. Linley in with him, talking
      over something. It looks as if he'd stay to dinner, doesn't it, my
      Lady?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;It does rather,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall I put dinner back a quarter of an hour? That would give you
      time to dress in comfort.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps you'd better.&quot;</p>
      <p>Mr. Linley was the general manager of the collieries, an elderly man
      from the north, with not quite enough punch to suit Clifford; not up to
      post-war conditions, nor post-war colliers either, with their `ca' canny'
      creed. But Connie liked Mr. Linley, though she was glad to be spared the
      toadying of his wife.</p>
      <p>Linley stayed to dinner, and Connie was the hostess men liked so much,
      so modest, yet so attentive and aware, with big, wide blue eyes arid a
      soft repose that sufficiently hid what she was really thinking. Connie had
      played this woman so much, it was almost second nature to her; but still,
      decidedly second. Yet it was curious how everything disappeared from her
      consciousness while she played it.</p>
      <p>She waited patiently till she could go upstairs and think her own
      thoughts. She was always waiting, it seemed to be her <i>forte</i>.</p>
