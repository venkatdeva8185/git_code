 <p>On a frosty morning with a little February sun, Clifford and Connie
      went for a walk across the park to the wood. That is, Clifford chuffed in
      his motor-chair, and Connie walked beside him.</p>
      <p>The hard air was still sulphurous, but they were both used to it. Round
      the near horizon went the haze, opalescent with frost and smoke, and on
      the top lay the small blue sky; so that it was like being inside an
      enclosure, always inside. Life always a dream or a frenzy, inside an
      enclosure.</p>
      <p>The sheep coughed in the rough, sere grass of the park, where frost lay
      bluish in the sockets of the tufts. Across the park ran a path to the
      wood-gate, a fine ribbon of pink. Clifford had had it newly gravelled with
      sifted gravel from the pit-bank. When the rock and refuse of the
      underworld had burned and given off its sulphur, it turned bright pink,
      shrimp-coloured on dry days, darker, crab-coloured on wet. Now it was pale
      shrimp-colour, with a bluish-white hoar of frost. It always pleased
      Connie, this underfoot of sifted, bright pink. It's an ill wind that
      brings nobody good.</p>
      <p>Clifford steered cautiously down the slope of the knoll from the hall,
      and Connie kept her hand on the chair. In front lay the wood, the hazel
      thicket nearest, the purplish density of oaks beyond. From the wood's edge
      rabbits bobbed and nibbled. Rooks suddenly rose in a black train, and went
      trailing off over the little sky.</p>
      <p>Connie opened the wood-gate, and Clifford puffed slowly through into
      the broad riding that ran up an incline between the clean-whipped thickets
      of the hazel. The wood was a remnant of the great forest where Robin Hood
      hunted, and this riding was an old, old thoroughfare coming across
      country. But now, of course, it was only a riding through the private
      wood. The road from Mansfield swerved round to the north.</p>
      <p>In the wood everything was motionless, the old leaves on the ground
      keeping the frost on their underside. A jay called harshly, many little
      birds fluttered. But there was no game; no pheasants. They had been killed
      off during the war, and the wood had been left unprotected, till now
      Clifford had got his game-keeper again.</p>
      <p>Clifford loved the wood; he loved the old oak-trees. He felt they were
      his own through generations. He wanted to protect them. He wanted this
      place inviolate, shut off from the world.</p>
      <p>The chair chuffed slowly up the incline, rocking and jolting on the
      frozen clods. And suddenly, on the left, came a clearing where there was
      nothing but a ravel of dead bracken, a thin and spindly sapling leaning
      here and there, big sawn stumps, showing their tops and their grasping
      roots, lifeless. And patches of blackness where the woodmen had burned the
      brushwood and rubbish.</p>
      <p>This was one of the places that Sir Geoffrey had cut during the war for
      trench timber. The whole knoll, which rose softly on the right of the
      riding, was denuded and strangely forlorn. On the crown of the knoll where
      the oaks had stood, now was bareness; and from there you could look out
      over the trees to the colliery railway, and the new works at Stacks Gate.
      Connie had stood and looked, it was a breach in the pure seclusion of the
      wood. It let in the world. But she didn't tell Clifford.</p>
      <p>This denuded place always made Clifford curiously angry. He had been
      through the war, had seen what it meant. But he didn't get really angry
      till he saw this bare hill. He was having it replanted. But it made him
      hate Sir Geoffrey.</p>
      <p>Clifford sat with a fixed face as the chair slowly mounted. When they
      came to the top of the rise he stopped; he would not risk the long and
      very jolty down-slope. He sat looking at the greenish sweep of the riding
      downwards, a clear way through the bracken and oaks. It swerved at the
      bottom of the hill and disappeared; but it had such a lovely easy curve,
      of knights riding and ladies on palfreys.</p>
      <p>&quot;I consider this is really the heart of England,&quot; said
      Clifford to Connie, as he sat there in the dim February sunshine.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you?&quot; she said, seating herself in her blue knitted
      dress, on a stump by the path.</p>
      <p>&quot;I do! this is the old England, the heart of it; and I intend to
      keep it intact.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh yes!&quot; said Connie. But, as she said it she heard the
      eleven-o'clock hooters at Stacks Gate colliery. Clifford was too used to
      the sound to notice.</p>
      <p>&quot;I want this wood perfect. . .untouched. I want nobody to trespass
      in it,&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>There was a certain pathos. The wood still had some of the mystery of
      wild, old England; but Sir Geoffrey's cuttings during the war had given it
      a blow. How still the trees were, with their crinkly, innumerable twigs
      against the sky, and their grey, obstinate trunks rising from the brown
      bracken! How safely the birds flitted among them! And once there had been
      deer, and archers, and monks padding along on asses. The place remembered,
      still remembered.</p>
      <p>Clifford sat in the pale sun, with the light on his smooth, rather
      blond hair, his reddish full face inscrutable.</p>
      <p>&quot;I mind more, not having a son, when I come here, than any other
      time,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;But the wood is older than your family,&quot; said Connie gently.</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite!&quot; said Clifford. &quot;But we've preserved it. Except
      for us it would go. . .it would be gone already, like the rest of the
      forest. One must preserve some of the old England!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Must one?&quot; said Connie. &quot;If it has to be preserved, and
      preserved against the new England? It's sad, I know.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;If some of the old England isn't preserved, there'll be no
      England at all,&quot; said Clifford. &quot;And we who have this kind of
      property, and the feeling for it, <i>must</i> preserve it.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was a sad pause.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, for a little while,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;For a little while! It's all we can do. We can only do our bit. I
      feel every man of my family has done his bit here, since we've had the
      place. One may go against convention, but one must keep up
      tradition.&quot; Again there was a pause.</p>
      <p>&quot;What tradition?&quot; asked Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;The tradition of England! of this!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said slowly.</p>
      <p>&quot;That's why having a son helps; one is only a link in a
      chain,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>Connie was not keen on chains, but she said nothing. She was thinking
      of the curious impersonality of his desire for a son.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm sorry we can't have a son,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>He looked at her steadily, with his full, pale-blue eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;It would almost be a good thing if you had a child by another
      man,&quot; he said. &quot;If we brought it up at Wragby, it would belong
      to us and to the place. I don't believe very intensely in fatherhood. If
      we had the child to rear, it would be our own, and it would carry on.
      Don't you think it's worth considering?&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie looked up at him at last. The child, her child, was just an
      &quot;it&quot; to him. It. . .it. . .it!</p>
