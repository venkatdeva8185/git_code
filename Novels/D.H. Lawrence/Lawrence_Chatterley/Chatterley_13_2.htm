 <p>Connie listened, and flushed very red.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'd like to give something,' she said. `But I'm not allowed.
      Everything is to be sold and paid for now; and all the things you mention
      now, Wragby and Shipley <i>sells</i> them to the people, at a good profit.
      Everything is sold. You don't give one heart-beat of real sympathy. And
      besides, who has taken away from the people their natural life and
      manhood, and given them this industrial horror? Who has done that?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And what must I do?&quot; he asked, green. &quot;Ask them to come
      and pillage me?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why is Tevershall so ugly, so hideous? Why are their lives so
      hopeless?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;They built their own Tevershall, that's part of their display of
      freedom. They built themselves their pretty Tevershall, and they live
      their own pretty lives. I can't live their lives for them. Every beetle
      must live its own life.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you make them work for you. They live the life of your
      coal-mine.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Not at all. Every beetle finds its own food. Not one man is
      forced to work for me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Their lives are industrialized and hopeless, and so are
      ours,&quot; she cried.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't think they are. That's just a romantic figure of speech,
      a relic of the swooning and die-away romanticism. You don't look at all a
      hopeless figure standing there, Connie my dear.&quot;</p>
      <p>Which was true. For her dark-blue eyes were flashing, her colour was
      hot in her cheeks, she looked full of a rebellious passion far from the
      dejection of hopelessness. She noticed, ill the tussocky places of the
      grass, cottony young cowslips standing up still bleared in their down. And
      she wondered with rage, why it was she felt Clifford was so <i>wrong</i>,
      yet she couldn't say it to him, she could not say exactly <i>where</i> he
      was wrong.</p>
      <p>&quot;No wonder the men hate you,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;They don't!&quot; he replied. &quot;And don't fall into errors:
      in your sense of the word, they are <i>not</i> men. They are animals you
      don't understand, and never could. Don't thrust your illusions on other
      people. The masses were always the same, and will always be the same.
      Nero's slaves were extremely little different from our colliers or the
      Ford motor-car workmen. I mean Nero's mine slaves and his field slaves. It
      is the masses: they are the unchangeable. An individual may emerge from
      the masses. But the emergence doesn't alter the mass. The masses are
      unalterable. It is one of the most momentous facts of social science. <i>Panem
      et circenses</i>! Only today education is one of the bad substitutes for a
      circus. What is wrong today is that we've made a profound hash of the
      circuses part of the programme, and poisoned our masses with a little
      education.&quot;</p>
      <p>When Clifford became really roused in his feelings about the common
      people, Connie was frightened. There was something devastatingly true in
      what he said. But it was a truth that killed.</p>
      <p>Seeing her pale and silent, Clifford started the chair again, and no
      more was said till he halted again at the wood gate, which she opened.</p>
      <p>&quot;And what we need to take up now,&quot; he said, &quot;is whips,
      not swords. The masses have been ruled since time began, and till time
      ends, ruled they will have to be. It is sheer hypocrisy and farce to say
      they can rule themselves.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But can you rule them?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;I? Oh yes! Neither my mind nor my will is crippled, and I don't
      rule with my legs. I can do my share of ruling: absolutely, my share; and
      give me a son, and he will be able to rule his portion after me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But he wouldn't be your own son, of your own ruling class; or
      perhaps not,&quot; she stammered.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't care who his father may be, so long as he is a healthy
      man not below normal intelligence. Give me the child of any healthy,
      normally intelligent man, and I will make a perfectly competent Chatterley
      of him. It is not who begets us, that matters, but where fate places us.
      Place any child among the ruling classes, and he will grow up, to his own
      extent, a ruler. Put kings' and dukes' children among the masses, and
      they'll be little plebeians, mass products. It is the overwhelming
      pressure of environment.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Then the common people aren't a race, and the aristocrats aren't
      blood,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;No, my child! All that is romantic illusion. Aristocracy is a
      function, a part of fate. And the masses are a functioning of another part
      of fate. The individual hardly matters. It is a question of which function
      you are brought up to and adapted to. It is not the individuals that make
      an aristocracy: it is the functioning of the aristocratic whole. And it is
      the functioning of the whole mass that makes the common man what he
      is.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Then there is no common humanity between us all!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Just as you like. We all need to fill our bellies. But when it
      comes to expressive or executive functioning, I believe there is a gulf
      and an absolute one, between the ruling and the serving classes. The two
      functions are opposed. And the function determines the individual.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie looked at him with dazed eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;Won't you come on?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>And he started his chair. He had said his say. Now he lapsed into his
      peculiar and rather vacant apathy, that Connie found so trying. In the
      wood, anyhow, she was determined not to argue.</p>
      <p>In front of them ran the open cleft of the riding, between the hazel
      walls and the gay grey trees. The chair puffed slowly on, slowly surging
      into the forget-me-nots that rose up in the drive like milk froth, beyond
      the hazel shadows. Clifford steered the middle course, where feet passing
      had kept a channel through the flowers. But Connie, walking behind, had
      watched the wheels jolt over the wood-ruff and the bugle, and squash the
      little yellow cups of the creeping-jenny. Now they made a wake through the
      forget-me-nots.</p>
      <p>All the flowers were there, the first bluebells in blue pools, like
      standing water.</p>
      <p>&quot;You are quite right about its being beautiful,&quot; said
      Clifford. &quot;It is so amazingly. What is <i>quite</i> so lovely as an
      English spring!&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie thought it sounded as if even the spring bloomed by act of
      Parliament. An English spring! Why not an Irish one? or Jewish? The chair
      moved slowly ahead, past tufts of sturdy bluebells that stood up like
      wheat and over grey burdock leaves. When they came to the open place where
      the trees had been felled, the light flooded in rather stark. And the
      bluebells made sheets of bright blue colour, here and there, sheering off
      into lilac and purple. And between, the bracken was lifting its brown
      curled heads, like legions of young snakes with a new secret to whisper to
      Eve.&nbsp;</p>
