 <p>Connie arrived home to an ordeal of cross-questioning. Clifford had
      been out at tea-time, had come in just before the storm, and where was her
      ladyship? Nobody knew, only Mrs. Bolton suggested she had gone for a walk
      into the wood. Into the wood, in such a storm!---Clifford for once let
      himself get into a state of nervous frenzy. He started at every flash of
      lightning, and blenched at every roll of thunder. He looked at the icy
      thunder-rain as if it dare the end of the world. He got more and more
      worked up.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton tried to soothe him.</p>
      <p>&quot;She'll be sheltering in the hut, till it's over. Don't worry, her
      Ladyship is all right.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't like her being in the wood in a storm like this! I don't
      like her being in the wood at all! She's been gone now more than two
      hours. When did she go out?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;A little while before you came in.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I didn't see her in the park. God knows where she is and what has
      happened to her.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, nothing's happened to her. You'll see, she'll be home
      directly after the rain stops. It's just the rain that's keeping
      her.&quot;</p>
      <p>But her ladyship did not come home directly the rain stopped. In fact
      time went by, the sun came out for his last yellow glimpse, and there
      still was no sign of her. The sun was set, it was growing dark, and the
      first dinner-gong had rung.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's no good!' said Clifford in a frenzy. &quot;I'm going to send
      out Field and Betts to find her.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh don't do that!&quot; cried Mrs. Bolton. &quot;They'll think
      there's a suicide or something. Oh don't start a lot of talk going.---Let
      me slip over to the hut and see if she's not there. I'll find her all
      right.&quot;</p>
      <p>So, after some persuasion, Clifford allowed her to go.</p>
      <p>And so Connie had come upon her in the drive, alone and palely
      loitering.</p>
      <p>&quot;You mustn't mind me coming to look for you, my Lady! But Sir
      Clifford worked himself up into such a state. He made sure you were struck
      by lightning, or killed by a falling tree. And he was determined to send
      Field and Betts to the wood to find the body. So I thought I'd better
      come, rather than set all the servants agog.&quot;</p>
      <p>She spoke nervously. She could still see on Connie's face the
      smoothness and the half-dream of passion, and she could feel the
      irritation against herself.</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite!&quot; said Connie. And she could say no more.</p>
      <p>The two women plodded on through the wet world, in silence, while great
      drops splashed like explosions in the wood. Ben they came to the park,
      Connie strode ahead, and Mrs. Bolton panted a little. She was getting
      plumper.</p>
      <p>&quot;How foolish of Clifford to make a fuss!&quot; said Connie at
      length, angrily, really speaking to herself.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, you know what men are! They like working themselves up. But
      he'll be all right as soon as he sees your Ladyship.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie was very angry that Mrs. Bolton knew her secret: for certainly
      she knew it.</p>
      <p>Suddenly Constance stood still on the path.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's monstrous that I should have to be followed!&quot; she said,
      her eyes flashing.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh! your Ladyship, don't say that! He'd certainly have sent the
      two men, and they'd have come straight to the hut. I didn't know where it
      was, really.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie flushed darker with rage, at the suggestion. Yet, while her
      passion was on her, she could not lie. She could not even pretend there
      was nothing between herself and the keeper. She looked at the other woman,
      who stood so sly, with her head dropped: yet somehow, in her femaleness,
      an ally.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh well!&quot; she said. &quot;I fit is so it is so. I don't
      mind!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, you're all right, my Lady! You've only been sheltering in
      the hut. It's absolutely nothing.&quot;</p>
      <p>They went on to the house. Connie marched in to Clifford's room,
      furious with him, furious with his pale, over-wrought fee and prominent
      eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;I must say, I don't think you need send the servants after
      me,&quot; she burst out.</p>
      <p>&quot;My God!&quot; he exploded. &quot;Where have you been, woman,
      You've been gone hours, hours, and in a storm like this! What the hell do
      you go to that-bloody wood for? What have you been up to? It's hours even
      since the rain stopped, hours! Do you know what time it is? You're enough
      to drive anybody mad. Where have you been? What in the name of hell have
      you been doing?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And what if I don't choose to tell you?&quot; She pulled her hat
      from her head and shook her hair.</p>
      <p>He lied at her with his eyes bulging, and yellow coming into the
      whites. It was very bad for him to get into these rages: Mrs. Bolton had a
      weary time with him, for days after. Connie felt a sudden qualm.</p>
      <p>&quot;But really!&quot; she said, milder. &quot;Anyone would think I'd
      been I don't know where! I just sat in the hut during all the storm, and
      made myself a little fire, and was happy.&quot;</p>
      <p>She spoke now easily. After all, why work him up any more!</p>
      <p>He looked at her suspiciously.</p>
      <p>&quot;And look at your hair!&quot; he said; &quot;look at
      yourself!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; she replied calmly. &quot;I ran out in the rain with
      no clothes on.&quot;</p>
      <p>He stared at her speechless.</p>
      <p>&quot;You must be mad!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why? To like a shower bath from the rain?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And how did you dry yourself?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;On an old towel and at the fire.&quot;</p>
      <p>He still stared at her in a dumbfounded way.</p>
      <p>&quot;And supposing anybody came,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Who would come?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Who? Why, anybody! And Mellors. Does he come? He must come in the
      evenings.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, he came later, when it had cleared up, to feed the pheasants
      with corn.&quot;</p>
      <p>She spoke with amazing nonchalance. Mrs. Bolton, who was listening in
      the next room, heard in sheer admiration. To think a woman could carry it
      off so naturally!</p>
      <p>&quot;And suppose he'd come while you were running about in the rain
      with nothing on, like a maniac?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I suppose he'd have had the fright of his life, and cleared out
      as fast as he could.&quot;</p>
      <p>Clifford still stared at her transfixed. What he thought in his
      under-consciousness he would never know. And he was too much taken aback
      to form one clear thought in his upper consciousness. He just simply
      accepted what she said, in a sort of blank. And he admired her. He could
      not help admiring her. She looked so flushed and handsome and smooth: love
      smooth.</p>
