 <p>&quot;You have a cough,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nothing--a cold! The last pneumonia left me with a cough, but
      it's nothing.&quot;</p>
      <p>He kept distant from her, and would not come any nearer.</p>
      <p>She went fairly often to the hut, in the morning or in the afternoon,
      but he was never there. No doubt he avoided her on purpose. He wanted to
      keep his own privacy.</p>
      <p>He had made the hut tidy, put the little table and chair near the
      fireplace, left a little pile of kindling and small logs, and put the
      tools and traps away as far as possible, effacing himself. Outside, by the
      clearing, he had built a low little roof of boughs and straw, a shelter
      for the birds, and under it stood the live coops. And, one day when she
      came, she found two brown hens sitting alert and fierce in the coops,
      sitting on pheasants' eggs, and fluffed out so proud and deep in all the
      heat of the pondering female blood. This almost broke Connie's heart. She,
      herself was so forlorn and unused, not a female at all, just a mere thing
      of terrors.</p>
      <p>Then all the live coops were occupied by hens, three brown and a grey
      and a black. All alike, they clustered themselves down on the eggs in the
      soft nestling ponderosity of the female urge, the female nature, fluffing
      out their feathers. And with brilliant eyes they watched Connie, as she
      crouched before them, and they gave short sharp clucks of anger and alarm,
      but chiefly of female anger at being approached.</p>
      <p>Connie found corn in the corn-bin in the hut. She offered it to the
      hens in her hand. They would not eat it. Only one hen pecked at her hand
      with a fierce little jab, so Connie was frightened. But she was pining to
      give them something, the brooding mothers who neither fed themselves nor
      drank. She brought water in a little tin, and was delighted when one of
      the hens drank.</p>
      <p>Now she came every day to the hens, they were the only things in the
      world that warmed her heart. Clifford's protestations made her go cold
      from head to foot. Mrs. Bolton's voice made her go cold, and the sound of
      the business men who came. An occasional letter from Michaelis affected
      her with the same sense of chill. She felt she would surely die if it
      lasted much longer.</p>
      <p>Yet it was spring, and the bluebells were coming in the wood, and the
      leaf-buds on the hazels were opening like the spatter of green rain. How
      terrible it was that it should be spring, and everything cold-hearted,
      cold-hearted. Only the hens, fluffed so wonderfully on the eggs, were warm
      with their hot, brooding female bodies! Connie felt herself living on the
      brink of fainting all the time.</p>
      <p>Then, one day, a lovely sunny day with great tufts of primroses under
      the hazels, and many violets dotting the paths, she came in the afternoon
      to the coops and there was one tiny, tiny perky chicken tinily prancing
      round in front of a coop, and the mother hen clucking in terror. The slim
      little chick was greyish brown with dark markings, and it was the most
      alive little spark of a creature in seven kingdoms at that moment. Connie
      crouched to watch in a sort of ecstasy. Life, life! pure, sparky, fearless
      new life! New life! So tiny and so utterly without fear! Even when it
      scampered a little, scrambling into the coop again, and disappeared under
      the hen's feathers in answer to the mother hen's wild alarm-cries, it was
      not really frightened, it took it as a game, the game of living. For in a
      moment a tiny sharp head was poking through the gold-brown feathers of the
      hen, and eyeing the Cosmos.</p>
      <p>Connie was fascinated. And at the same time, never had she felt so
      acutely the agony of her own female forlornness. It was becoming
      unbearable.</p>
      <p>She had only one desire now, to go to the clearing in the wood. The
      rest was a kind of painful dream. But sometimes she was kept all day at
      Wragby, by her duties as hostess. And then she felt as if she too were
      going blank, just blank and insane.</p>
      <p>One evening, guests or no guests, she escaped after tea. It was late,
      and she fled across the park like one who fears to be called back. The sun
      was setting rosy as she entered the wood, but she pressed on among the
      flowers. The light would last long overhead.</p>
      <p>She arrived at the clearing flushed and semi-conscious. The keeper was
      there, in his shirt-sleeves, just closing up the coops for the night, so
      the little occupants would be safe. But still one little trio was
      pattering about on tiny feet, alert drab mites, under the straw shelter,
      refusing to be called in by the anxious mother.</p>
      <p>&quot;I had to come and see the chickens!&quot; she said, panting,
      glancing shyly at the keeper, almost unaware of him. &quot;Are there any
      more?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Thirty-six so far!&quot; he said. &quot;Not bad!&quot;</p>
      <p>He too took a curious pleasure in watching the young things come out.</p>
      <p>Connie crouched in front of the last coop. The three chicks had run in.
      But still their cheeky heads came poking sharply through the yellow
      feathers, then withdrawing, then only one beady little head eyeing forth
      from the vast mother-body.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'd love to touch them,&quot; she said, putting her lingers
      gingerly through the bars of the coop. But the mother-hen pecked at her
      hand fiercely, and Connie drew back startled and frightened.</p>
      <p>&quot;How she pecks at me! She hates me!&quot; she said in a wondering
      voice. &quot;But I wouldn't hurt them!&quot;</p>
      <p>The man standing above her laughed, and crouched down beside her, knees
      apart, and put his hand with quiet confidence slowly into the coop. The
      old hen pecked at him, but not so savagely. And slowly, softly, with sure
      gentle lingers, he felt among the old bird's feathers and drew out a
      faintly-peeping chick in his closed hand.</p>
      <p>&quot;There!&quot; he said, holding out his hand to her. She took the
      little drab thing between her hands, and there it stood, on its impossible
      little stalks of legs, its atom of balancing life trembling through its
      almost weightless feet into Connie's hands. But it lifted its handsome,
      clean-shaped little head boldly, and looked sharply round, and gave a
      little &quot;peep&quot;. &quot;So adorable! So cheeky!&quot; she said
      softly.</p>
      <p>The keeper, squatting beside her, was also watching with an amused face
      the bold little bird in her hands. Suddenly he saw a tear fall on to her
      wrist.</p>
      <p>And he stood up, and stood away, moving to the other coop. For suddenly
      he was aware of the old flame shooting and leaping up in his loins, that
      he had hoped was quiescent for ever. He fought against it, turning his
      back to her. But it leapt, and leapt downwards, circling in his knees.</p>
      <p>He turned again to look at her. She was kneeling and holding her two
      hands slowly forward, blindly, so that the chicken should run in to the
      mother-hen again. And there was something so mute and forlorn in her,
      compassion flamed in his bowels for her.</p>
