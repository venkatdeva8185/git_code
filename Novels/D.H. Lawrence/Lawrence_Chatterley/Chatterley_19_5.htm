&quot;If you could only tell them that living and spending isn't the same
      thing! But it's no good. If only they were educated to <i>live</i> instead
      of earn and spend, they could manage very happily on twenty-five
      shillings. If the men wore scarlet trousers as I said, they wouldn't think
      so much of money: if they could dance and hop and skip, and sing and
      swagger and be handsome, they could do with very little cash. And amuse
      the women themselves, and be amused by the women. They ought to learn to
      be naked and handsome, and to sing in a mass and dance the old group
      dances, and carve the stools they sit on, and embroider their own emblems.
      Then they wouldn't need money. And that's the only way to solve the
      industrial problem: train the people to be able to live and live in
      handsomeness, without needing to spend. But you can't do it. They're all
      one-track minds nowadays. Whereas the mass of people oughtn't even to try
      to think, because they can't. They should be alive and frisky, and
      acknowledge the great god Pan. He's the only god for the masses, forever.
      The few can go in for higher cults if they like. But let the mass be
      forever pagan.
      <p>&quot;But the colliers aren't pagan, far from it. They're a sad lot, a
      deadened lot of men: dead to their women, dead to life. The young ones
      scoot about on motor-bikes with girls, and jazz when they get a chance,
      But they're very dead. And it needs money. Money poisons you when you've
      got it, and starves you when you haven't.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm sure you're sick of all this. But I don't want to harp on myself,
      and I've nothing happening to me. I don't like to think too much about
      you, in my head, that only makes a mess of us both. But, of course, what I
      live for now is for you and me to live together. I'm frightened, really. I
      feel the devil in the air, and he'll try to get us. Or not the devil,
      Mammon: which I think, after all, is only the mass-will of people, wanting
      money and hating life. Anyhow, I feel great grasping white hands in the
      air, wanting to get hold of the throat of anybody who tries to live, to
      live beyond money, and squeeze the life out. There's a bad time coming.
      There's a bad time coming, boys, there's a bad time coming! If things go
      on as they are, there's nothing lies in the future but death and
      destruction, for these industrial masses. I feel my inside turn to water
      sometimes, and there you are, going to have a child by me. But never mind.
      All the bad times that ever have been, haven't been able to blow the
      crocus out: not even the love of women. So they won't be able to blow out
      my wanting you, nor the little glow there is between you and me. We'll be
      together next year. And though I'm frightened, I believe in your being
      with me. A man has to fend and fettle for the best, and then trust in
      something beyond himself. You can't insure against the future, except by
      really believing in the best bit of you, and in the power beyond it. So I
      believe in the little flame between us. For me now, it's the only thing in
      the world. I've got no friends, not inward friends. Only you. And now the
      little flame is all I care about in my life. There's the baby, but that is
      a side issue. It's my Pentecost, the forked flame between me and you. The
      old Pentecost isn't quite right. Me and God is a bit uppish, somehow. But
      the little forked flame between me and you: there you are! That's what I
      abide by, and will abide by, Cliffords and Berthas, colliery companies and
      governments and the money-mass of people all notwithstanding.</p>
      <p>&quot;That's why I don't like to start thinking about you actually. It only
      tortures me, and does you no good. I don't want you to be away from me.
      But if I start fretting it wastes something. Patience, always patience.
      This is my fortieth winter. And I can't help all the winters that have
      been. But this winter I'll stick to my little Pentecost flame, and have
      some peace. And I won't let the breath of people blow it out. I believe in
      a higher mystery, that doesn't let even the crocus be blown out. And if
      you're in Scotland and I'm in the Midlands, and I can't put my arms round
      you, and wrap my legs round you, yet I've got something of you. My soul
      softly Naps in the little Pentecost flame with you, like the peace of
      fucking. We fucked a flame into being. Even the flowers are fucked into
      being between the sun and the earth. But it's a delicate thing, and takes
      patience and the long pause.</p>
      <p>&quot;So I love chastity now, because it is the peace that comes of fucking.
      I love being chaste now. I love it as snowdrops love the snow. I love this
      chastity, which is the pause of peace of our fucking, between us now like
      a snowdrop of forked white fire. And when the real spring comes, when the
      drawing together comes, then we can fuck the little flame brilliant and
      yellow, brilliant. But not now, not yet! Now is the time to be chaste, it
      is so good to be chaste, like a river of cool water in my soul. I love the
      chastity now that it flows between us. It is like fresh water and rain.
      How can men want wearisomely to philander. What a misery to be like Don
      Juan, and impotent ever to fuck oneself into peace, and the little flame
      alight, impotent and unable to be chaste in the cool between-whiles, as by
      a river.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, so many words, because I can't touch you. If I could sleep with
      my arms round you, the ink could stay in the bottle. We could be chaste
      together just as we can fuck together. But we have to be separate for a
      while, and I suppose it is really the wiser way. If only one were sure.</p>
      <p>&quot;Never mind, never mind, we won't get worked up. We really trust in the
      little flame, and in the unnamed god that shields it from being blown out.
      There's so much of you here with me, really, that it's a pity you aren't
      all here.</p>
      <p>&quot;Never mind about Sir Clifford. If you don't hear anything from him,
      never mind. He can't really do anything to you. Wait, he will want to get
      rid of you at last, to cast you out. And if he doesn't, we'll manage to
      keep clear of him. But he will. In the end he will want to spew you out as
      the abominable thing.</p>
      <p>&quot;Now I can't even leave off writing to you.</p>
      <p>&quot;But a great deal of us is together, and we can but abide by it, and
      steer our courses to meet soon. John Thomas says good-night to Lady Jane,
      a little droopingly, but with a hopeful heart.&quot;</p>
