 <p>No! said Connie to herself I'd rather be at Wragby, where I can go
      about and be still, and not stare at anything or do any performing of any
      sort. This tourist performance of enjoying oneself is too hopelessly
      humiliating: it's such a failure.</p>
      <p>She wanted to go back to Wragby, even to Clifford, even to poor
      crippled Clifford. He wasn't such a fool as this swarming holidaying lot,
      anyhow.</p>
      <p>But in her inner consciousness she was keeping touch with the other
      man. She mustn't let her connection with him go: oh, she mustn't let it
      go, or she was lost, lost utterly in this world of riff-raffy expensive
      people and joy-hogs. Oh, the joy-hogs! Oh `enjoying oneself'! Another
      modern form of sickness.</p>
      <p>They left the car in Mestre, in a garage, and took the regular steamer
      over to Venice. It was a lovely summer afternoon, the shallow lagoon
      rippled, the full sunshine made Venice, turning its back to them across
      the water, look dim.</p>
      <p>At the station quay they changed to a gondola, giving the man the
      address. He was a regular gondolier in a white-and-blue blouse, not very
      good-looking, not at all impressive.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! The Villa Esmeralda! Yes! I know it! I have been the
      gondolier for a gentleman there. But a fair distance out!&quot;</p>
      <p>He seemed a rather childish, impetuous fellow. He rowed with a certain
      exaggerated impetuosity, through the dark side-canals with the horrible,
      slimy green walls, the canals that go through the poorer quarters, where
      the washing hangs high up on ropes, and there is a slight, or strong,
      odour of sewage.</p>
      <p>But at last he came to one of the open canals with pavement on either
      side, and looping bridges, that run straight, at right-angles to the Grand
      Canal. The two women sat under the little awning, the man was perched
      above, behind them.</p>
      <p>&quot;Are the signorine staying long at the Villa Esmeralda?&quot; he
      asked, rowing easy, and `wiping his perspiring face with a white-and-blue
      handkerchief.</p>
      <p>&quot;Some twenty days: we are both married ladies,&quot; said Hilda,
      in her curious hushed voice, that made her Italian sound so foreign.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah! Twenty days!&quot; said the man. There was a pause. After
      which he asked: &quot;Do the signore want a gondolier for the twenty days
      or so that they will stay at the Villa Esmeralda? Or by the day, or by the
      week?&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie and Hilda considered. In Venice, it is always preferable to have
      one's own gondola, as it is preferable to have one's own car on land.</p>
      <p>&quot;What is there at the Villa? what boats?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;There is a motor-launch, also a gondola. But---&quot; The <i>but</i>
      meant: they won't be your property.</p>
      <p>&quot;How much do you charge?&quot;</p>
      <p>It was about thirty shillings a day, or ten pounds a week.</p>
      <p>&quot;Is that the regular price?&quot; asked Hilda.</p>
      <p>&quot;Less, Signora, less. The regular price---&quot;</p>
      <p>The sisters considered.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Hilda, &quot;come tomorrow morning, and we will
      arrange it. What is your name?&quot;</p>
      <p>His name was Giovanni, and he wanted to know at what time he should
      come, and then for whom should he say he was waiting. Hilda had no card.
      Connie gave him one of hers. He glanced at it swiftly, with his hot,
      southern blue eyes, then glanced again.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he said, lighting up. &quot;Milady! Milady, isn't
      it?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Milady Costanza!&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>He nodded, repeating: &quot;Milady Costanza!&quot; and putting the card
      carefully away in his blouse.</p>
      <p>The Villa Esmeralda was quite a long way out, on the edge of the lagoon
      looking towards Chioggia. It was not a very old house, and pleasant, with
      the terraces looking seawards, and below, quite a big garden with dark
      trees, walled in from the lagoon.</p>
      <p>Their host was a heavy, rather coarse Scotchman who had made a good
      fortune in Italy before the war, and had been knighted for his
      ultrapatriotism during the war. His wife was a thin, pale, sharp kind of
      person with no fortune of her own, and the misfortune of having to
      regulate her husband's rather sordid amorous exploits. He was terribly
      tiresome with the servants. But having had a slight stroke during the
      winter, he was now more manageable.</p>
      <p>The house was pretty full. Besides Sir Malcolm and his two daughters,
      there were seven more people, a Scotch couple, again with two daughters; a
      young Italian Contessa, a widow; a young Georgian prince, and a youngish
      English clergyman who had had pneumonia and was being chaplain to Sir
      Alexander for his health's sake. The prince was penniless, good-looking,
      would make an excellent chauffeur, with the necessary impudence, and basta!
      The Contessa was a quiet little puss with a game on somewhere. The
      clergyman was a raw simple fellow from a Bucks vicarage: luckily he had
      left his wife and two children at home. And the Guthries, the family of
      four, were good solid Edinburgh middle class, enjoying everything in a
      solid fashion, and daring everything while risking nothing.</p>
      <p>Connie and Hilda ruled out the prince at once. The Guthries were more
      or less their own sort, substantial, hut boring: and the girls wanted
      husbands. The chaplain was not a had fellow, but too deferential. Sir
      Alexander, after his slight stroke, had a terrible heaviness his
      joviality, but he was still thrilled at the presence of so many handsome
      young women. Lady Cooper was a quiet, catty person who had a thin time of
      it, poor thing, and who watched every other woman with a cold watchfulness
      that had become her second nature, and who said cold, nasty little things
      which showed what an utterly low opinion she had of all human nature. She
      was also quite venomously overbearing with the servants, Connie found: but
      in a quiet way. And she skilfully behaved so that Sir Alexander should
      think that <i>he</i> was lord and monarch of the whole caboosh, with his
      stout, would-be-genial paunch, and his utterly boring jokes, his
      humourosity, as Hilda called it.</p>
      <p>Sir Malcolm was painting. Yes, he still would do a Venetian lagoonscape,
      now and then, in contrast to his Scottish landscapes. So in the morning he
      was rowed off with a huge canvas, to his `site'. A little later, Lady
      Cooper would he rowed off into the heart of the city, with sketching-block
      and colours. She was an inveterate watercolour painter, and the house was
      full of rose-coloured palaces, dark canals, swaying bridges, medieval
      facades, and so on. A little later the Guthries, the prince, the countess,
      Sir Alexander, and sometimes Mr. Lind, the chaplain, would go off to the
      Lido, where they would bathe; coming home to a late lunch at half past
      one.</p>
