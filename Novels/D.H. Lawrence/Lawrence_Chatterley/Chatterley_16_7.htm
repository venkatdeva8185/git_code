 <p>She had often wondered what Abélard meant, when he said that in their
      year of love he and Héloïse had passed through all the stages and
      refinements of passion. The same thing, a thousand years ago: ten thousand
      years ago! The same on the Greek vases, everywhere! The refinements of
      passion, the extravagances of sensuality! And necessary, forever
      necessary, to burn out false shames and smelt out the heaviest ore of the
      body into purity. With the fire of sheer sensuality.</p>
      <p>In the short summer night she learnt so much. She would have thought a
      woman would have died of shame. Instead of which, the shame died. Shame,
      which is fear: the deep Organic shame, the old, old physical fear which
      crouches in the bodily roots of us, and can only be chased away by the
      sensual fire, at last it was roused up and routed by the phallic hunt of
      the man, and she came to the very heart of the jungle of herself. She
      felt, now, she had come to the real bed-rock of her nature, and was
      essentially shameless. She was her sensual self, naked and unashamed. She
      felt a triumph, almost a vainglory. So! That was how it was! That was
      life! That was how oneself really was! There was nothing left to disguise
      or be ashamed of. She shared her ultimate nakedness with a man, another
      being.</p>
      <p>And what a reckless devil the man was! really like a devil! One had to
      be strong to bear him. But it took some getting at, the core of the
      physical jungle, the last and deepest recess of organic shame. The phallus
      alone could explore it. And how he had pressed in on her!</p>
      <p>And how, in fear, she had hated it. But how she had really wanted it!
      She knew now. At the bottom of her soul, fundamentally, she had needed
      this phallic hunting Out, she had secretly wanted it, and she had believed
      that she would never get it. Now suddenly there it was, and a man was
      sharing her last and final nakedness, she was shameless.</p>
      <p>What liars poets and everybody were! They made one think one wanted
      sentiment. When what one supremely wanted was this piercing, consuming,
      rather awful sensuality. To find a man who dared do it, without shame or
      sin or final misgiving! If he had been ashamed afterwards, and made one
      feel ashamed, how awful! What a pity most men are so doggy, a bit
      shameful, like Clifford! Like Michaelis even! Both sensually a bit doggy
      and humiliating. The supreme pleasure of the mind! And what is that to a
      woman? What is it, really, to the man either! He becomes merely messy and
      doggy, even in his mind. It needs sheer sensuality even to purify and
      quicken the mind. Sheer fiery sensuality, not messiness.</p>
      <p>Ah, God, how rare a thing a man is! They are all dogs that trot and
      sniff and copulate. To have found a man who was not afraid and not
      ashamed! She looked at him now, sleeping so like a wild animal asleep,
      gone, gone in the remoteness of it. She nestled down, not to be away from
      him.</p>
      <p>Till his rousing waked her completely. He was sitting up in bed,
      looking down at her. She saw her own nakedness in his eyes, immediate
      knowledge of her. And the fluid, male knowledge of herself seemed to flow
      to her from his eyes and wrap her voluptuously. Oh, how voluptuous and
      lovely it was to have limbs and body half-asleep, heavy and suffused with
      passion.</p>
      <p>&quot;Is it time to wake up?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Half past six.&quot;</p>
      <p>She had to be at the lane-end at eight. Always, always, always this
      compulsion on one!</p>
      <p>&quot;I might make the breakfast and bring it up here; should I?&quot;
      he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh yes!&quot;</p>
      <p>Flossie whimpered gently below. He got up and threw off his pajamas,
      and rubbed himself with a towel. When the human being is full of courage
      and full of life, how beautiful it is! So she thought, as she watched him
      in silence.</p>
      <p>&quot;Draw the curtain, will you?&quot;</p>
      <p>The sun was shining already on the tender green leaves of morning, and
      the wood stood bluey-fresh, in the nearness. She sat up in bed, looking
      dreamily out through the dormer window, her naked arms pushing her naked
      breasts together. He was dressing himself. She was half-dreaming of life,
      a life together with him: just a life.</p>
      <p>He was going, fleeing from her dangerous, crouching nakedness.</p>
      <p>&quot;Have I lost my nightie altogether?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>He pushed his hand down in the bed, and pulled out the bit of flimsy
      silk.</p>
      <p>&quot;I knowed I felt silk at my ankles,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>But the night-dress was slit almost in two.</p>
      <p>&quot;Never mind!&quot; she said. &quot;It belongs here, really. I'll
      leave it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, leave it, I can put it between my legs at night, for company.
      There's no name nor mark on it, is there?&quot;</p>
      <p>She slipped on the torn thing, and sat dreamily looking out of the
      window. The window was Open, the air of morning drifted in, and the sound
      of birds. Birds flew continuously past. Then she saw Flossie roaming out.
      It was morning.</p>
      <p>Downstairs she heard him making the fire, pumping water, going out at
      the back door. By and by came the smell of bacon, and at length he came
      upstairs with a huge black tray that would only just go through the door.
      He set the tray on the bed, and poured out the tea. Connie squatted in her
      torn nightdress, and fell on her food hungrily. He sat on the one chair,
      with his plate on his knees.</p>
      <p>&quot;How good it is!&quot; she said. &quot;How nice to have breakfast
      together.&quot;</p>
      <p>He ate in silence, his mind on the time that was quickly passing. That
      made her remember.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, how I wish I could stay here with you, and Wragby were a
      million miles away! It's Wragby I'm going away from really. You know that,
      don't you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And you promise we will live together and have a life together,
      you and me! You promise me, don't you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! When we can.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! And we <i>will</i>! we <i>will</i>, won't we?&quot; she
      leaned over, making the tea spill, catching his wrist.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; he said, tidying up the tea.</p>
      <p>&quot;We can't possibly <i>not</i> live together now, can we?&quot; she
      said appealingly.</p>
      <p>He looked up at her with his flickering grin.</p>
      <p>&quot;No!&quot; he said. &quot;Only you've got to start in twenty-five
      minutes.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Have I?&quot; she cried. Suddenly he held up a warning finger,
      and rose to his feet.</p>
      <p>Flossie had given a short bark, then three loud sharp yaps of warning.</p>
      <p>Silent, he put his plate on the tray and went downstairs. Constance
      heard him go down the garden path. A bicycle bell tinkled outside there.</p>
