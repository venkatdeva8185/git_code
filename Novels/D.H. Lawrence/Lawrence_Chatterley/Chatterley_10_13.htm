 <p>He went a little nearer, gun in hand, and stood motionless on the
      drive, watching the house. Perhaps even now he could find her, come at her
      in some way. The house was not impregnable: he was as clever as burglars
      are. Why not come to her?</p>
      <p>He stood motionless, waiting, while the dawn faintly and imperceptibly
      paled behind him. He saw the light in the house go out. But he did not see
      Mrs. Bolton come to the window and draw back the old curtain of dark-blue
      silk, and stand herself in the dark room, looking out on the half-dark of
      the approaching day, looking for the longed-for dawn, waiting, waiting for
      Clifford to be really reassured that it was daybreak. For when he was sure
      of daybreak, he would sleep almost at once.</p>
      <p>She stood blind with sleep at the window, waiting. And as she stood,
      she started, and almost cried out. For there was a man out there on the
      drive, a black figure in the twilight. She woke up greyly, and watched,
      but without making a sound to disturb Sir Clifford.</p>
      <p>The daylight began to rustle into the world, and the dark figure seemed
      to go smaller and more defined. She made out the gun and gaiters and baggy
      jacket---it would be Oliver Mellors, the keeper. Yes, for there was the
      dog nosing around like a shadow, and waiting for him'!</p>
      <p>And what did the man want? Did he want to rouse the house? What was he
      standing there for, transfixed, looking up at the house like a love-sick
      male dog outside the house where the bitch is?</p>
      <p>Goodness! The knowledge went through Mrs. Bolton like a shot. He was
      Lady Chatterley's lover! He! He!</p>
      <p>To think of it! Why, she, Ivy Bolton, had once been a tiny bit in love
      with him herself. When he was a lad of sixteen and she a woman of
      twenty-six. It was when she was studying, and he had helped her a lot with
      the anatomy and things she had had to learn. He'd been a clever boy, had a
      scholarship for Sheffield Grammar School, and learned French and things:
      and then after all had become an overhead blacksmith shoeing horses,
      because he was fond of horses, he said: but really because he was
      frightened to go out and face the world, only he'd never admit it.</p>
      <p>But he'd been a nice lad, a nice lad, had helped her a lot, so clever
      at making things clear to you. He was quite as clever as Sir Clifford: and
      always one for the women. More with women than men, they said.</p>
      <p>Till he'd gone and married that Bertha Coutts, as if to spite himself.
      Some people do marry to spite themselves, because they're disappointed of
      something. And no wonder it had been a failure.---For years he was gone,
      all the time of the war: and a lieutenant and all: quite the gentleman,
      really quite the gentleman!---Then to come back to Tevershall and go as a
      game-keeper! Really, some people can't take their chances when they've got
      them! And talking broad Derbyshire again like the worst, when she, Ivy
      Bolton, knew he spoke like any gentleman, <i>really</i>.</p>
      <p>Well, well! So her ladyship had fallen for him! Well her ladyship
      wasn't the first: there was something about him. But fancy! A Tevershall
      lad born and bred, and she her ladyship in Wragby Hall! My word, that was
      a slap back at the high-and-mighty Chatterleys!</p>
      <p>But he, the keeper, as the day grew, had realized: it's no good! It's
      no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. You've got to stick to it
      all your life. Only at times, at times, the gap will be filled in. At
      times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and
      stick to it, all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is
      filled in, when they come. But they've got to come. You can't force them.</p>
      <p>With a sudden snap the bleeding desire that had drawn him after her
      broke. He had broken it, because it must be so. There must be a coming
      together on both sides. And if she wasn't coming to him, he wouldn't track
      her down. He mustn't. He must go away, till she came.</p>
      <p>He turned slowly, ponderingly, accepting again the isolation. He knew
      it was better so. She must come to him: it was no use his trailing after
      her. No use!</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton saw him disappear, saw his dog run after him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, well!&quot; she said. &quot;He's the one man I never
      thought of; and the one man I might have thought of. He was nice to me
      when he was a lad, after I lost Ted. Well, well! Whatever would he say if
      he knew!&quot;</p>
      <p>And she glanced triumphantly at the already sleeping Clifford, as she
      stepped softly from the room.</p>
