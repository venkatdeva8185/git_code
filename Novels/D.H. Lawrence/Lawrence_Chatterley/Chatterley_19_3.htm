 <p>&quot;I suppose you don't at all mind having gone back on your
      word?&quot; he said at last.</p>
      <p>&quot;I can't help it,&quot; she murmured.</p>
      <p>&quot;But if you can't, who can?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I suppose nobody.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her with curious cold rage. He was used to her. She was as
      it were embedded in his will. How dared she now go back on him, and
      destroy the fabric of his daily existence? How dared she try to cause this
      derangement of his personality?</p>
      <p>&quot;And for <i>what</i> do you want to go back on everything?&quot;
      he insisted.</p>
      <p>&quot;Love!' she said. It was best to be hackneyed.</p>
      <p>&quot;Love of Duncan Forbes? But you didn't think that worth having,
      when you met me. Do you mean to say you now love him better than anything
      else in life?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;One changes,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Possibly! Possibly you may have whims. But you still have to
      convince me of the importance of the change. I merely don't believe in
      your love of Duncan Forbes.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But why <i>should</i> you believe in it? You have only to divorce
      me, not to believe in my feelings.'</p>
      <p>&quot;And why should I divorce you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Because I don't want to live here any more. And you really don't
      want me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Pardon me! I don't change. For my part, since you are my wife, I
      should prefer that you should stay under my roof in dignity and quiet.
      Leaving aside personal feelings, and I assure you, on my part it is
      leaving aside a great deal, it is bitter as death to me to have this order
      of life broken up, here in Wragby, and the decent round of daily life
      smashed, just for some whim of yours.&quot;</p>
      <p>After a time of silence she said:</p>
      <p>&quot;I can't help it. I've got to go. I expect I shall have a
      child.&quot;</p>
      <p>He too was silent for a time.</p>
      <p>&quot;And is it for the child's sake you must go?&quot; he asked at
      length.</p>
      <p>She nodded.</p>
      <p>&quot;And why? Is Duncan Forbes so keen on his spawn?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Surely keener than you would be,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;But really? I want my wife, and I see no reason for letting her
      go. If she likes to bear a child under my roof, she is welcome, and the
      child is welcome: provided that the decency and order of life is
      preserved. Do you mean to tell me that Duncan Forbes has a greater hold
      over you? I don't believe it.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was a pause.</p>
      <p>&quot;But don't you see,&quot; said Connie. &quot;I <i>must</i> go away
      from you, and I must live with the man I love.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, I don't see it! I don't give tuppence for your love, nor for
      the man you love. I don't believe in that sort of cant.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you see, I do.'</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you? My dear Madam, you are too intelligent, I assure you, to
      believe in your own love for Duncan Forbes. Believe me, even now you
      really care more for me. So why should I give in to such nonsense!&quot;</p>
      <p>She felt he was right there. And she felt she could keep silent no
      longer.</p>
      <p>&quot;Because it isn't Duncan that I <i>do</i> love,&quot; she said,
      looking up at him.</p>
      <p>&quot;We only said it was Duncan, to spare your feelings.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;To spare my feelings?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! Because who I really love, and it'll make you hate me, is
      Mr. Mellors, who was our game-keeper here.&quot;</p>
      <p>If he could have sprung out of his chair, he would have done so. His
      face went yellow, and his eyes bulged with disaster as he glared at her.</p>
      <p>Then he dropped back in the chair, gasping and looking up at the
      ceiling.</p>
      <p>At length he sat up.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you mean to say you re telling me the truth?' he asked,
      looking gruesome.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! You know I am.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And when did you begin with him?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;In the spring.&quot;</p>
      <p>He was silent like some beast in a trap.</p>
      <p>&quot;And it <i>was</i> you, then, in the bedroom at the cottage?&quot;</p>
      <p>So he had really inwardly known all the time.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
      <p>He still leaned forward in his chair, gazing at her like a cornered
      beast.</p>
      <p>&quot;My God, you ought to be wiped off the face of the earth!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why?&quot; she ejaculated faintly.</p>
      <p>But he seemed not to hear.</p>
      <p>&quot;That scum! That bumptious lout! That miserable cad! And carrying
      on with him all the time, while you were here and he was one of my
      servants! My God, my God, is there any end to the beastly lowness of
      women!&quot;</p>
      <p>He was beside himself with rage, as she knew he would be.</p>
      <p>&quot;And you mean to say you want to have a child to a cad like
      that?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! I'm going to.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You're going to! You mean you're sure! How long have you been
      sure?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Since June.&quot;</p>
      <p>He was speechless, and the queer blank look of a child came over him
      again.</p>
      <p>&quot;You'd wonder,&quot; he said at last, &quot;that such beings were
      ever allowed to be born.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What beings?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>He looked at her weirdly, without an answer. It was obvious, he
      couldn't even accept the fact of the existence of Mellors, in any
      connection with his own life. It was sheer, unspeakable, impotent hate.</p>
      <p>&quot;And do you mean to say you'd marry him?---and bear his foul
      name?&quot; he asked at length.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, that's what I want.&quot;</p>
      <p>He was again as if dumbfounded.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes!' he said at last. &quot;That proves that what I've always
      thought about you is correct: you're not normal, you're not in your right
      senses. You're one of those half-insane, perverted women who must run
      after depravity, the <i>nostalgie de la boue</i>.&quot;</p>
      <p>Suddenly he had become almost wistfully moral, seeing himself the
      incarnation of good, and people like Mellors and Connie the incarnation of
      mud, of evil. He seemed to be growing vague, inside a nimbus.</p>
      <p>&quot;So don't you think you'd better divorce me and have done with
      it?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! You can go where you like, but I shan't divorce you,&quot; he
      said idiotically.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
      <p>He was silent, in the silence of imbecile obstinacy.</p>
      <p>&quot;Would you even let the child be legally yours, and your
      heir?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;I care nothing about the child.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But if it's a boy it will be legally your son, and it will
      inherit your title, and have Wragby.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I care nothing about that,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you <i>must!</i> I shall prevent the child from being legally
      yours, if I can. I'd so much rather it were illegitimate, and mine: if it
      can't be Mellors'.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do as you like about that.&quot;</p>
      <p>He was immovable.</p>
      <p>&quot;And won't you divorce me?&quot; she said. &quot;You can use
      Duncan as a pretext! There'd be no need to bring in the real name. Duncan
      doesn't mind.&quot;</p>
