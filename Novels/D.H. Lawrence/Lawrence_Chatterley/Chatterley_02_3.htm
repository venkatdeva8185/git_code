 <p>&quot;A demi-vierge!&quot; replied Connie vaguely. &quot;Why? Why
      not?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Unless you like it, of course!&quot; said her father hastily. To
      Clifford he said the same, when the two men were alone: &quot;I'm afraid
      it doesn't quite suit Connie to be a demi-vierge.'&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;A half-virgin!&quot; replied Clifford, translating the phrase to
      be sure of it.</p>
      <p>He thought for a moment, then flushed very red. He was angry and
      offended.</p>
      <p>&quot;In what way doesn't it suit her?&quot; he asked stiffly.</p>
      <p>&quot;She's getting thin. . .angular. It's not her style. She's not the
      pilchard sort of little slip of a girl, she's a bonny Scotch trout.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Without the spots, of course!&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>He wanted to say something later to Connie about the demi-vierge
      business...the half-virgin state of her affairs. But he could not bring
      himself to do it. He was at once too intimate with her and not intimate
      enough. He was so very much at one with her, in his mind and hers, but
      bodily they were non-existent to one another, and neither could bear to
      drag in the corpus delicti. They were so intimate, and utterly out of
      touch.</p>
      <p>Connie guessed, however, that her father had said something, and that
      something was in Clifford's mind. She knew that he didn't mind whether she
      were demi-vierge or demi-monde, so long as he didn't absolutely know, and
      wasn't made to see. What the eye doesn't see and the mind doesn't know,
      doesn't exist.</p>
      <p>Connie and Clifford had now been nearly two years at Wragby, living
      their vague life of absorption in Clifford and his work. Their interests
      had never ceased to flow together over his work. They talked and wrestled
      in the throes of composition, and felt as if something were happening,
      really happening, really in the void.</p>
      <p>And thus far it was a life: in the void. For the rest it was
      non-existence. Wragby was there, the servants. . .but spectral, not really
      existing. Connie went for walks in the park, and in the woods that joined
      the park, and enjoyed the solitude and the mystery, kicked the brown
      leaves of autumn, and picked the primroses of spring. But it was all a
      dream; or rather it was like the simulacrum of reality. The oak-leaves
      were to her like oak-leaves seen ruffling in a mirror, she herself was a
      figure somebody had read about, picking primroses that were only shadows
      or memories, or words. No substance to her or anything. . .no touch, no
      contact! Only this life with Clifford, this endless spinning of webs of
      yarn, of the minutiae of consciousness, these stories Sir Malcolm said
      there was nothing in, and they wouldn't last. Why should there be anything
      in them, why should they last? Sufficient unto the day is the evil
      thereof. Sufficient unto the moment is the <i>appearance</i> of reality.</p>
      <p>Clifford had quite a number of friends, acquaintances really, and he
      invited them to Wragby. He invited all sorts of people, critics and
      writers, people who would help to praise his books. And they were
      flattered at being asked to Wragby, and they praised. Connie understood it
      all perfectly. But why not? This was one of the fleeting patterns in the
      mirror. What was wrong with it?</p>
      <p>She was hostess to these people. . .mostly men. She was hostess also to
      Clifford's occasional aristocratic relations. Being a soft, ruddy,
      country-looking girl, inclined to freckles, with big blue eyes, and
      curling, brown hair, and a soft voice, and rather strong, female loins she
      was considered a little old-fashioned and &quot;womanly&quot;. She was not
      a &quot;little pilchard sort of fish&quot;, like a boy, with a boy's flat
      breast and little buttocks. She was too feminine to be quite smart.</p>
      <p>So the men, especially those no longer young, were very nice to her
      indeed. But, knowing what torture poor Clifford would feel at the
      slightest sign of flirting on her part, she gave them no encouragement at
      all. She was quiet and vague, she had no contact with them and intended to
      have none. Clifford was extraordinarily proud of himself.</p>
      <p>His relatives treated her quite kindly. She knew that the kindliness
      indicated a lack of fear, and that these people had no respect for you
      unless you could frighten them a little. But again she had no contact. She
      let them be kindly and disdainful, she let them feel they had no need to
      draw their steel in readiness. She had no real connection with them.</p>
      <p>Time went on. Whatever happened, nothing happened, because she was so
      beautifully out of contact. She and Clifford lived in their ideas and his
      books. She entertained. . .there were always people in the house. Time
      went on as the clock does, half past eight instead of half past seven.</p>
