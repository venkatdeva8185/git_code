 <p>Once in her room, however, she felt still vague and confused. She
      didn't know what to think. What sort of a man was he, really? Did he
      really like her? Not much, she felt. Yet he was kind. There was something,
      a sort of warm naive kindness, curious and sudden, that almost opened her
      womb to him. But she felt he might be kind like that to any woman. Though
      even so, it was curiously soothing, comforting. And he was a passionate
      man, wholesome and passionate. But perhaps he wasn't quite individual
      enough; he might be the same with any woman as he had been with her. It
      really wasn't personal. She was only really a female to him.</p>
      <p>But perhaps that was better. And after all, he was kind to the female
      in her, which no man had ever been. Men were very kind to the <i>person </i>she
      was, but rather cruel to the female, despising her or ignoring her
      altogether. Men were awfully kind to Constance Reid or to Lady Chatterley;
      but not to her womb they weren't kind. And he took no notice of Constance
      or of Lady Chatterley; he just softly stroked her loins or her breasts.</p>
      <p>She went to the wood next day. It was a grey, still afternoon, with the
      dark-green dogs-mercury spreading under the hazel copse, and all the trees
      making a silent effort to open their buds. Today she could almost feel it
      in her own body, the huge heave of the sap in the massive trees, upwards,
      up, up to the bud-a, there to push into little flamey oak-leaves, bronze
      as blood. It was like a ride running turgid upward, and spreading on the
      sky.</p>
      <p>She came to the clearing, but he was not there. She had only half
      expected him. The pheasant chicks were running lightly abroad, light as
      insects, from the coops where the fellow hens clucked anxiously. Connie
      sat and watched them, and waited. She only waited. Even the chicks she
      hardly saw. She waited.</p>
      <p>The time passed with dream-like slowness, and he did not come. She had
      only half expected him. He never came in the afternoon. She must go home
      to tea. But she had to force herself to leave.</p>
      <p>As she went home, a fine drizzle of rain fell.</p>
      <p>&quot;Is it raining again?&quot; said Clifford, seeing her shake her
      hat.</p>
      <p>&quot;Just drizzle.&quot;</p>
      <p>She poured tea in silence, absorbed in a sort of obstinacy. She did
      want to see the keeper today, to see if it were really real. If it were
      really real.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall I read a little to you afterwards?&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>She looked at him. Had he sensed something?</p>
      <p>&quot;The spring makes me feel queer--I thought I might rest a
      little,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Just as you like. Not feeling really unwell, are you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! Only rather tired--with the spring. Will you have Mrs. Bolton
      to play something with you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! I think I'll listen in.&quot;</p>
      <p>She heard the curious satisfaction in his voice. She went upstairs to
      her bedroom. There she heard the loudspeaker begin to bellow, in an
      idiotically velveteen-genteel sort of voice, something about a series of
      street-cries, the very cream of genteel affectation imitating old criers.
      She pulled on her old violet coloured mackintosh, and slipped out of the
      house at the side door.</p>
      <p>The drizzle of rain was like a veil over the world, mysterious, hushed,
      not cold. She got very warm as she hurried across the park. She had to
      open her light waterproof.</p>
      <p>The wood was silent, still and secret in the evening drizzle of rain,
      full of the mystery of eggs and half-open buds, half unsheathed flowers.
      In the dimness of it all trees glistened naked and dark as if they had
      unclothed themselves, and the green things on earth seemed to hum with
      greenness.</p>
      <p>There was still no one at the clearing. The chicks had nearly all gone
      under the mother-hens, only one or two last adventurous ones still dibbed
      about in the dryness under the straw roof shelter. And they were doubtful
      of themselves.</p>
      <p>So! He still had not been. He was staying away on purpose. Or perhaps
      something was wrong. Perhaps she should go to the cottage and see.</p>
      <p>But she was born to wait. She opened the hut with her key. It was all
      tidy, the corn put in the bin, the blankets folded on the shelf, the straw
      neat in a corner; a new bundle of straw. The hurricane lamp hung on a
      nail. The table and chair had been put back where she had lain.</p>
      <p>She sat down on a stool in the doorway. How still everything was! The
      fine rain blew very softly, filmily, but the wind made no noise. Nothing
      made any sound. The trees stood like powerful beings, dim, twilit, silent
      and alive. How alive everything was!</p>
      <p>Night was drawing near again; she would have to go. He was avoiding
      her.</p>
      <p>But suddenly he came striding into the clearing, in his black oilskin
      jacket like a chauffeur, shining with wet. He glanced quickly at the hut,
      half-saluted, then veered aside and went on to the coops. There he
      crouched in silence, looking carefully at everything, then carefully
      shutting the hens and chicks up safe against the night.</p>
      <p>At last he came slowly towards her. She still sat on her stool. He
      stood before her under the porch.</p>
      <p>&quot;You come then,&quot; he said, using the intonation of the
      dialect.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, looking up at him. &quot;You're late!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; he replied, looking away into the wood.</p>
      <p>She rose slowly, drawing aside her stool.</p>
      <p>&quot;Did you want to come in?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>He looked down at her shrewdly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Won't folks be thinkin' somethink, you comin' here every
      night?&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why?&quot; She looked up at him, at a loss. &quot;I said I'd
      come. Nobody knows.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;They soon will, though,&quot; he replied. &quot;An' what
      then?&quot;</p>
      <p>She was at a loss for an answer.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why should they know?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Folks always does,&quot; he said fatally.</p>
      <p>Her lip quivered a little.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well I can't help it,&quot; she faltered.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he said. &quot;You can help it by not comin'---if yer
      want to,&quot; he added, in a lower tone.</p>
      <p>&quot;But I don't want to,&quot; she murmured.</p>
      <p>He looked away into the wood, and was silent.</p>
      <p>&quot;But what when folks finds out?&quot; he asked at last.
      &quot;Think about it! Think how lowered you'll feel, one of your husband's
      servants.&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked up at his averted face.</p>
      <p>&quot;Is it,&quot; she stammered, &quot;is it that you don't want
      me?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Think!&quot; he said. &quot;Think what if folks find out ---Sir
      Clifford an' a'--an' everybody talkin'--'-&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, I can go away.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Anywhere! I've got money of my own. My mother left me twenty
      thousand pounds in trust, and I know Clifford can't touch it. I can go
      away.&quot;</p>
