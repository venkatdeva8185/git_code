 <p>&quot;Thank you <i>so</i> much! You do read Racine beautifully!&quot;
      she said softly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Almost as beautifully as you listen to him,&quot; he said
      cruelly. &quot;What are you making?&quot; he asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm making a child's dress, for Mrs. Flint's baby.&quot;</p>
      <p>He turned away. A child! A child! That was all her obsession.</p>
      <p>&quot;After all,&quot; he said in a declamatory voice, &quot;one gets
      all one wants out of Racine. Emotions that are ordered and given shape are
      more important than disorderly emotions.&quot;</p>
      <p>She watched him with wide, vague, veiled eyes. &quot;Yes, I'm sure they
      are,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;The modern world has only vulgarized emotion by letting it loose.
      What we need is classic control.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said slowly, thinking of him listening with vacant
      face to the emotional idiocy of the radio. &quot;People pretend to have
      emotions, and they really feel nothing. I suppose that is being
      romantic.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Exactly!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, he was tired. This evening had tired him. He would
      rather have been with his technical books, or his pit-manager, or
      listening-in to the radio.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton came in with two glasses of malted milk: for Clifford, to
      make him sleep, and for Connie, to fatten her again. It was a regular
      night-cap she had introduced.</p>
      <p>Connie was glad to go, when she had drunk her glass, and thankful she
      needn't help Clifford to bed. She took his glass and put it on the tray,
      then took the tray, to leave it outside.</p>
      <p>&quot;Goodnight Clifford! <i>Do</i> sleep well! The Racine gets into
      one like a dream. Goodnight!&quot;</p>
      <p>She had drifted to the door. She was going without kissing him
      goodnight. He watched her with sharp, cold eyes. So! She did not even kiss
      him goodnight, after he had spent an evening reading to her. Such depths
      of callousness in her! Even if the kiss was but a formality, it was on
      such formalities that life depends. She was a Bolshevik, really. Her
      instincts were Bolshevistic! He gazed coldly and angrily at the door
      whence she had gone. Anger!</p>
      <p>And again the dread of the night came on him. He was a network of
      nerves, and when he was not braced up to work, and so full of energy: or
      when he was not listening-in, and so utterly neuter: then he was haunted
      by anxiety and a sense of dangerous impending void. He was afraid. And
      Connie could keep the fear off him, if she would. But it was obvious she
      wouldn't, she wouldn't. She was callous, cold and callous to all that he
      did for her. He gave up his life for her, and she was callous to him. She
      only wanted her own way. &quot;The lady loves her will.&quot;</p>
      <p>Now it was a baby she was obsessed by. Just so that it should be her
      own, all her own, and not his!</p>
      <p>Clifford was so healthy, considering. He looked so well and ruddy in
      the face, his shoulders were broad and strong, his chest deep, he had put
      on flesh. And yet, at the same time, he was afraid of death. A terrible
      hollow seemed to menace him somewhere, somehow, a void, and into this void
      his energy would collapse. Energyless, he felt at times he was dead,
      really dead.</p>
      <p>So his rather prominent pale eyes had a queer look, furtive, and yet a
      little cruel, so cold: and at the same time, almost impudent. It was a
      very odd look, this look of impudence: as if he were triumphing over life
      in spite of life. &quot;Who knoweth the mysteries of the will--for it can
      triumph even against the angels---&quot;</p>
      <p>But his dread was the nights when he could not sleep. Then it was awful
      indeed, when annihilation pressed in on him on every side. Then it was
      ghastly, to exist without having any life: lifeless, in the night, to
      exist.</p>
      <p>But now he could ring for Mrs. Bolton. And she would always come. That
      was a great comfort. She would come in her dressing gown, with her hair in
      a plait down her back, curiously girlish and dim, though the brown plait
      was streaked with grey. And she would make him coffee or camomile tea, and
      she would play chess or piquet with him. She had a woman's queer faculty
      of playing even chess well enough, when she was three parts asleep, well
      enough to make her worth beating. So, in the silent intimacy of the night,
      they sat, or she sat and he lay on the bed, with the reading-lamp shedding
      its solitary light on them, she almost gone in sleep, he almost gone in a
      sort of fear, and they played, played together--then they had a cup of
      coffee and a biscuit together, hardly speaking, in the silence of night,
      but being a reassurance to one another.</p>
      <p>And this night she was wondering who Lady Chatterley's lover was. And
      she was thinking of her own Ted, so long dead, yet for her never quite
      dead. And when she thought of him, the old, old grudge against the world
      rose up, but especially against the masters, that they had killed him.
      They had not really killed him. Yet, to her, emotionally, they had. And
      somewhere deep in herself because of it, she was a nihilist, and really
      anarchic.</p>
      <p>In her half-sleep, thoughts of her Ted and thoughts of Lady
      Chatterley's unknown lover commingled, and then she felt she shared with
      the other woman a great grudge against Sir Clifford and all he stood for.
      At the same time she was playing piquet with him, and they were gambling
      sixpences. And it was a source of satisfaction to be playing piquet with a
      baronet, and even losing sixpences to him.</p>
      <p>When they played cards, they always gambled. It made him forget
      himself. And he usually won. Tonight too he was winning. So he would not
      go to sleep till the first dawn appeared. Luckily it began to appear at
      half past four or thereabouts.</p>
      <p>Connie was in bed, and fast asleep all this time. But the keeper, too,
      could not rest. He had closed the coops and made his round of the wood,
      then gone home and eaten supper. But he did not go to bed. Instead he sat
      by the fire and thought.</p>
      <p>He thought of his boyhood in Tevershall, and of his five or six years
      of married life. He thought of his wife, and always bitterly. She had
      seemed so brutal. But he had not seen her now since 1915, in the spring
      when he joined up. Yet there she was, not three miles away, and more
      brutal than ever. He hoped never to see her again while he lived.</p>
      <p>He thought of his life abroad, as a soldier. India, Egypt, then India
      again: the blind, thoughtless life with the horses: the colonel who had
      loved him and whom he had loved: the several years that he had been an
      officer, a lieutenant with a very fair chance of being a captain. Then the
      death of the colonel from pneumonia, and his own narrow escape from death:
      his damaged health: his deep restlessness: his leaving the army and coming
      back to England to be a working man again.</p>
