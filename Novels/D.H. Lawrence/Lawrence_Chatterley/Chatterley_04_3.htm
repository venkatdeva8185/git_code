 <p>But then Mick wasn't trying to do anything, but just get through his
      life, and put as much across other people as they tried to put across him.
      He was really anti-social, which was what Clifford and his cronies had
      against him. Clifford and his cronies were not anti-social; they were more
      or less bent on saving mankind, or on instructing it, to say the least.</p>
      <p>There was a gorgeous talk on Sunday evening, when the conversation
      drifted again to love.</p>
      <p>&quot;Blest be the tie that binds<br>
      Our hearts in kindred something-or-other&quot;--</p>
      <p>said Tommy Dukes. &quot;I'd like to know what the tie is. . .The tie
      that binds <i>us</i> just now is mental friction on one another. And,
      apart from that, there's damned little tie between us. We bust apart, and
      say spiteful things about one another, like all the other damned
      intellectuals in the world. Damned everybodies, as far as that goes, for
      they all do it. Else we bust apart, and cover up the spiteful things we
      feel against one another by saying false sugaries. It's a curious thing
      that the mental life seems to flourish with its roots in spite, ineffable
      and fathomless spite. Always has been so! Look at Socrates, in Plato, and
      his bunch round him! The sheer spite of it all, just sheer joy in pulling
      somebody else to bits. . .Protagoras, or whoever it was! And Alcibiades,
      and all the other little disciple dogs joining in the fray! I must say it
      makes one prefer Buddha, quietly sitting under a bo-tree, or Jesus,
      telling his disciples little Sunday stories, peacefully, and without any
      mental fireworks. No, there's something wrong with the mental life,
      radically. It's rooted in spite and envy, envy and spite. Ye shall know
      the tree by its fruit.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't think we're altogether so spiteful,&quot; protested
      Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;My dear Clifford, think of the way we talk each other over, all
      of us. I'm rather worse than anybody else, myself. Because I infinitely
      prefer the spontaneous spite to the concocted sugaries; now they <i>are </i>poison;
      when I begin saying what a fine fellow Clifford is, etc., etc., then poor
      Clifford is to be pitied. For God's sake, all of you, say spiteful things
      about me, then I shall know I mean something to you. Don't say sugaries,
      or I'm done.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, but I do think we honestly like one another,&quot; said
      Hammond.</p>
      <p>&quot;I tell you we must. . .we say such spiteful things to one
      another, about one another, behind our backs! I'm the worst.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And I do think you confuse the mental life with the critical
      activity. I agree with you, Socrates gave the critical activity a grand
      start, but he did more than that,&quot; said Charlie May, rather
      magisterially. The cronies had such a curious pomposity under their
      assumed modesty. It was all so <i>ex cathedra</i>, and it all pretended to
      be so humble.</p>
      <p>Dukes refused to be drawn about Socrates.</p>
      <p>&quot;That's quite true, criticism and knowledge are not the same
      thing,&quot; said Hammond.</p>
      <p>&quot;They aren't, of course,&quot; chimed in Berry, a brown, shy young
      man, who had called to see Dukes, and was staying the night.</p>
      <p>They all looked at him as if the ass had spoken.</p>
      <p>&quot;I wasn't talking about knowledge. . .I was talking about the
      mental life,&quot; laughed Dukes. &quot;Real knowledge comes out of the
      whole corpus of the consciousness; out of your belly and your penis as
      much as out of your brain and mind. The mind can only analyze and
      rationalize. Set the mind and the reason to cock it over the rest, and all
      they can do is to criticize, and make a deadness. I say <i>all</i> they
      can do. It is vastly important. My God, the world needs criticizing today.
      . .criticizing to death. Therefore let's live the mental life, and glory
      in our spite, and strip the rotten old show. But, mind you, it's like
      this: while you <i>live </i>your life, you are in some way an Organic
      whole with all life. But once you start the mental life you pluck the
      apple. You've severed the connection between the apple and the tree: the
      organic connection. And if you've got nothing in your life <i>but </i>the
      mental life, then you yourself are a plucked apple. . .you've fallen off
      the tree. And then it is a logical necessity to be spiteful, just as it's
      a natural necessity for a plucked apple to go bad.&quot;</p>
      <p>Clifford made big eyes: it was all stuff to him. Connie secretly
      laughed to herself.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well then we're all plucked apples,&quot; said Hammond, rather
      acidly and petulantly.</p>
      <p>&quot;So let's make cider of ourselves,&quot; said Charlie.</p>
      <p>&quot;But what do you think of Bolshevism?&quot; put in the brown
      Berry, as if everything had led up to it.</p>
      <p>&quot;Bravo!&quot; roared Charlie. &quot;What do you think of
      Bolshevism?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Come on! Let's make hay of Bolshevism!&quot; said Dukes.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm afraid Bolshevism is a large question,&quot; said Hammond,
      shaking his head seriously.</p>
      <p>&quot;Bolshevism, it seems to me,&quot; said Charlie, &quot;is just a
      superlative hatred of the thing they call the bourgeois; and what the
      bourgeois is, isn't quite defined. It is Capitalism, among other things.
      Feelings and emotions are also so decidedly bourgeois that you have to
      invent a man without them.</p>
      <p>&quot;Then the individual, especially the <i>personal </i>man, is
      bourgeois: so he must be suppressed. You must submerge yourselves in the
      greater thing, the Soviet-social thing. Even an organism is bourgeois: so
      the ideal must be mechanical. The only thing that is a unit, non-organic,
      composed of many different, yet equally essential parts, is the machine.
      Each man a machine-part, and the driving power of the machine, hate. .
      .hate of the bourgeois. That, to me, is Bolshevism.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Absolutely!&quot; said Tommy. &quot;But also, it seems to me a
      perfect description of the whole of the industrial ideal. It's the
      factory-owner's ideal in a nut-shell; except that he would deny that the
      driving power was hate. Hate it is, all the same; hate of life itself.
      Just look at these Midlands, if it isn't plainly written up. . .but it's
      all part of the life of the mind, it's a logical development.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I deny that Bolshevism is logical, it rejects the major part of
      the premisses,'&quot; said Hammond.</p>
