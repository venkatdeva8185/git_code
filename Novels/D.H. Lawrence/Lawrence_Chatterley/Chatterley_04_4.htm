 <p>&quot;My dear man, it allows the material premiss; so does the pure
      mind. . .exclusively.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;At least Bolshevism has got down to rock bottom,&quot; said
      Charlie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Rock bottom! The bottom that has no bottom! The Bolshevists will
      have the finest army in the world in a very short time, with the finest
      mechanical equipment.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But this thing can't go on. . .this hate business. There must be
      a reaction. . .&quot; said Hammond.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, we've been waiting for years. . .we wait longer. Hate's a
      growing thing like anything else. It's the inevitable outcome of forcing
      ideas on to life, of forcing one's deepest instincts; our deepest feelings
      we force according to certain ideas. We drive ourselves with a formula,
      like a machine. The logical mind pretends to rule the roost, and the roost
      turns into pure hate. We're all Bolshevists, only we are hypocrites. The
      Russians are Bolshevists without hypocrisy.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But there are many other ways,&quot; said Hammond, &quot;than the
      Soviet way. The Bolshevists aren't really intelligent.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Of course not. But sometimes it's intelligent to be half-witted:
      if you want to make your end. Personally, I consider Bolshevism
      half-witted; but so do I consider our social life in the west half-witted.
      So I even consider our far-famed mental life half-witted. We're all as
      cold as cretins, we're all as passionless as idiots. We're all of us
      Bolshevists, only we give it another name. We think we're gods. . .men
      like gods! It's just the same as Bolshevism. One has to be human, and have
      a heart and a penis if one is going to escape being either a god or a
      Bolshevist. . .for they are the same thing: they're both too good to be
      true.&quot;</p>
      <p>Out of the disapproving silence came Berry's anxious question:</p>
      <p>&quot;You do believe in love then, Tommy, don't you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You lovely lad!&quot; said Tommy. &quot;No, my cherub, nine times
      out of ten, no! Love's another of those half-witted performances today.
      Fellows with swaying waists fucking little jazz girls with small boy
      buttocks, like two collar studs! Do you mean that sort of love? Or the
      joint-property, make-a-success-of-it, My-husband-my-wife sort of love? No,
      my fine fellow, I don't believe in it at all!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you do believe in something?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Me? Oh, intellectually I believe in having a good heart, a chirpy
      penis, a lively intelligence, and the courage to say 'shit!' in front of a
      lady.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, you've got them all,&quot; said Berry.</p>
      <p>Tommy Dukes roared with laughter. &quot;You angel boy! If only I had!
      If only I had! No; my heart's as numb as a potato, my penis droops and
      never lifts its head up, I dare rather cut him clean off than say 'shit!'
      in front of my mother or my aunt. . .they are real ladies, mind you; and
      I'm not really intelligent, I'm only a 'mental-lifer'. It would be
      wonderful to be intelligent: then one would be alive in all the parts
      mentioned and unmentionable. The penis rouses his head and says: How do
      you do? to any really intelligent person. Renoir said he painted his
      pictures with his penis. . .he did too, lovely pictures! I wish I did
      something with mine. God! when one can only talk! Another torture added to
      Hades! And Socrates started it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;There are nice women in the world,&quot; said Connie, lifting her
      head up and speaking at last.</p>
      <p>The men resented it. . .she should have pretended to hear nothing. They
      hated her admitting she had attended so closely to such talk.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;My God! -- <i>If they be not nice to me<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        What care I how nice they be</i>? --''</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&quot;No, it's hopeless! I just simply can't vibrate in unison with a
      woman. There's no woman I can really want when I'm faced with her, and I'm
      not going to start forcing myself to it. . .My God, no! I'll remain as I
      am, and lead the mental life. It's the only honest thing I can do. I can
      be quite happy <i>talking</i> to women; but it's all pure, hopelessly
      pure. Hopelessly pure! What do you say, Hildebrand, my chicken?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;It's much less complicated if one stays pure,&quot; said Berry.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, life is all too simple!&quot;</p>
