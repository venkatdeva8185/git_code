 <p>Clifford kept the chair going till he came to the brow of the hill;
      Connie followed slowly behind. The oak-buds were opening soft and brown.
      Everything came tenderly out of the old hardness. Even the snaggy craggy
      oak-trees put out the softest young leaves, spreading thin, brown little
      wings like young bat-wings in the light. Why had men never any newness in
      them, any freshness to come forth with! Stale men!</p>
      <p>Clifford stopped the chair at the top of the rise and looked down. The
      bluebells washed blue like flood-water over the broad riding, and lit up
      the downhill with a warm blueness.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's a very fine colour in itself,&quot; said Clifford, &quot;but
      useless for making a painting.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite!&quot; said Connie, completely uninterested.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall I venture as far as the spring?&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Will the chair get up again?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;We'll try; nothing venture, nothing win!&quot;</p>
      <p>And the chair began to advance slowly, joltingly down the beautiful
      broad riding washed over with blue encroaching hyacinths. Oh last of all
      ships, through the hyacinthian shallows! Oh pinnace on the last wild
      waters, sailing in the last voyage of our civilization! Whither, O weird
      wheeled ship, your slow course steering. Quiet and complacent, Clifford
      sat at the wheel of adventure: in his old black hat and tweed jacket,
      motionless and cautious. O Captain, my Captain, our splendid trip is done!
      Not yet though! Downhill, in the wake, came Constance in her grey dress,
      watching the chair jolt downwards.</p>
      <p>They passed the narrow track to the hut. Thank heaven it was not wide
      enough for the chair: hardly wide enough for one person. The chair reached
      the bottom of the slope, and swerved round, to disappear. And Connie heard
      a low whistle behind her. She glanced sharply round: the keeper was
      striding downhill towards her, his dog keeping behind him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Is Sir Clifford going to the cottage?&quot; he asked, looking
      into her eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;No, only to the well.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah! Good! Then I can keep out of sight. But I shall see you
      tonight. I shall wait for you at the park-gate about ten.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked again direct into her eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she faltered.</p>
      <p>They heard the Papp! Papp! of Clifford's horn, tooting for Connie. She
      &quot;Coo-eed!&quot; in reply. The keeper's face flickered with a little
      grimace, and with his hand he softly brushed her breast upwards, from
      underneath. She looked at him, frightened, and started running down the
      hill, calling Coo-ee! again to Clifford. The man above watched her, then
      turned, grinning faintly, back into his path.</p>
      <p>She found Clifford slowly mounting to the spring, which was halfway up
      the slope of the dark larch-wood. He was there by the time she caught him
      up.</p>
      <p>&quot;She did that all right,&quot; he said, referring to the chair.</p>
      <p>Connie looked at the great grey leaves of burdock that grew out ghostly
      from the edge of the larch-wood. The people call it Robin Hood's Rhubarb.
      How silent and gloomy it seemed by the well! Yet the water bubbled so
      bright, wonderful! And there were bits of eye-bright and strong blue
      bugle. . .And there, under the bank, the yellow earth was moving. A mole!
      It emerged, rowing its pink hands, and waving its blind gimlet of a face,
      with the tiny pink nose-tip uplifted.</p>
      <p>&quot;It seems to see with the end of its nose,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Better than with its eyes!&quot; he said. &quot;Will you
      drink?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Will you?&quot;</p>
      <p>She took an enamel mug from a twig on a tree, and stooped to fill it
      for him. He drank in sips. Then she stooped again, and drank a little
      herself.</p>
      <p>&quot;So icy!&quot; she said gasping.</p>
      <p>&quot;Good, isn't it! Did you wish?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Did you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, I wished. But I won't tell.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was aware of the rapping of a woodpecker, then of the wind, soft
      and eerie through the larches. She looked up. White clouds were crossing
      the blue.</p>
      <p>&quot;Clouds!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;White lambs only,&quot; he replied.</p>
      <p>A shadow crossed the little clearing. The mole had swum out on to the
      soft yellow earth.</p>
      <p>&quot;Unpleasant little beast, we ought to kill him,&quot; said
      Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Look! he's like a parson in a pulpit,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>She gathered some sprigs of woodruff and brought them to him.</p>
      <p>&quot;New-mown hay!&quot; he said. &quot;Doesn't it smell like the
      romantic ladies of the last century, who had their heads screwed on the
      right way after all!&quot;</p>
      <p>She was looking at the white clouds.</p>
      <p>&quot;I wonder if it will rain,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Rain! Why! Do you want it to?&quot;</p>
      <p>They started on the return journey, Clifford jolting cautiously
      downhill. They came to the dark bottom of the hollow, turned to the right,
      and after a hundred yards swerved up the foot of the long slope, where
      bluebells stood in the light.</p>
      <p>&quot;Now, old girl!&quot; said Clifford, putting the chair to it.</p>
      <p>It was a steep and jolty climb. The chair pugged slowly, in a
      struggling unwilling fashion. Still, she nosed her way up unevenly, till
      she came to where the hyacinths were all around her, then she balked,
      struggled, jerked a little way out of the flowers, then stopped</p>
      <p>&quot;We'd better sound the horn and see if the keeper will come,&quot;
      said Connie. &quot;He could push her a bit. For that matter, I will push.
      It helps.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;We'll let her breathe,&quot; said Clifford. &quot;Do you mind
      putting a scotch under the wheel?&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie found a stone, and they waited. After a while Clifford started
      his motor again, then set the chair in motion. It struggled and faltered
      like a sick thing, with curious noises.</p>
      <p>&quot;Let me push!&quot; said Connie, coming up behind.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! Don't push!&quot; he said angrily. &quot;What's the good of
      the damned thing, if it has to be pushed! Put the stone under!&quot;</p>
      <p>There was another pause, then another start; but more ineffectual than
      before.</p>
      <p>&quot;You <i>must</i> let me push,&quot; said she. &quot;Or sound the
      horn for the keeper.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Wait!&quot;</p>
      <p>She waited; and he had another try, doing more harm than good.</p>
      <p>&quot;Sound the horn then, if you won't let me push,&quot; she said.
      &quot;Hell! Be quiet a moment!&quot;</p>
      <p>She was quiet a moment: he made shattering efforts with the little
      motor.</p>
      <p>&quot;You'll only break the thing down altogether, Clifford,&quot; she
      remonstrated; &quot;besides wasting your nervous energy.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;If I could only get out and look at the damned thing!&quot; he
      said, exasperated. And he sounded the horn stridently. &quot;Perhaps
      Mellors can see what's wrong.&quot;</p>
