 <p>He looked pale, and his brows were sombre.</p>
      <p>&quot;And were you sorry when I came along?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;I was sorry and I was glad.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And what are you now?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm sorry, from the outside: all the complications and the
      ugliness and recrimination that's bound to come, sooner or later. That's
      when my blood sinks, and I'm low. But when my blood comes up, I'm glad.
      I'm even triumphant. I was really getting bitter. I thought there was no
      real sex left: never a woman who'd really ``come'' naturally with a man:
      except black women, and somehow, well, we're white men: and they're a bit
      like mud.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And now, are you glad of me?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! When I can forget the rest. When I can't forget the rest, I
      want to get under the table and die.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why under the table?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why?&quot; he laughed. &quot;Hide, I suppose. Baby!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You do seem to have had awful experiences of women,&quot; she
      said.</p>
      <p>&quot;You see, I couldn't fool myself. That's where most men manage.
      They take an attitude, and accept a lie. I could never fool myself. I knew
      what I wanted with a woman, and I could never say I'd got it when I
      hadn't.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But have you got it now?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Looks as if I might have.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Then why are you so pale and gloomy?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Bellyful of remembering: and perhaps afraid of myself.&quot;</p>
      <p>She sat in silence. It was growing late.</p>
      <p>&quot;And do you think it's important, a man and a woman?&quot; she
      asked him.</p>
      <p>&quot;For me it is. For me it's the core of my life: if I have a right
      relation with a woman.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And if you didn't get it?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Then I'd have to do without.&quot;</p>
      <p>Again she pondered, before she asked:</p>
      <p>&quot;And do you think you've always been right with women?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;God, no! I let my wife get to what she was: my fault a good deal.
      I spoilt her. And I'm very mistrustful. You'll have to expect it. It takes
      a lot to make me trust anybody, inwardly. So perhaps I'm a fraud too. I
      mistrust. And tenderness is not to be mistaken.&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked at him.</p>
      <p>&quot;You don't mistrust with your body, when your blood comes
      up,&quot; she said. &quot;You don't mistrust then, do you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, alas! That's how I've got into all the trouble. And that's
      why my mind mistrusts so thoroughly.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Let your mind mistrust. What does it matter!&quot;</p>
      <p>The dog sighed with discomfort on the mat. The ash-clogged fire sank.</p>
      <p>&quot;We <i>are</i> a couple of battered warriors,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Are you battered too?&quot; he laughed. &quot;And here we are
      returning to the fray!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! I feel really frightened.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot;</p>
      <p>He got up, and put her shoes to dry, and wiped his own and set them
      near the fire. In the morning he would grease them. He poked the ash of
      pasteboard as much as possible out of the fire. `Even burnt, it's filthy,'
      he said. Then he brought sticks and put them on the hob for the morning.
      Then he went out awhile with the dog.</p>
      <p>When he came back, Connie said:</p>
      <p>&quot;I want to go out too, for a minute.&quot;</p>
      <p>She went alone into the darkness. There were stars overhead. She could
      smell flowers on the night air. And she could feel her wet shoes getting
      wetter again. But she felt like going away, right away from him and
      everybody.</p>
      <p>It was chilly. She shuddered, and returned to the house. He was sitting
      in front of the low fire.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ugh! Cold!&quot; she shuddered.</p>
      <p>He put the sticks on the fire, and fetched more, till they had a good
      crackling chimneyful of blaze. The rippling running yellow flame made them
      both happy, warmed their faces and their souls.</p>
      <p>&quot;Never mind!&quot; she said, taking his hand as he sat silent and
      remote. &quot;One does one's best.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; He sighed, with a twist of a smile.</p>
      <p>She slipped over to him, and into his arms, as he sat there before the
      fire.</p>
      <p>&quot;Forget then!&quot; she whispered. &quot;Forget!&quot;</p>
      <p>He held her close, in the running warmth of the fire. The flame itself
      was like a forgetting. And her soft, warm, ripe weight! Slowly his blood
      turned, and began to ebb back into strength and reckless vigour again.</p>
      <p>&quot;And perhaps the women <i>really</i> wanted to be there and love
      you properly, only perhaps they couldn't. Perhaps it wasn't all their
      fault,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;I know it. Do you think I don't know what a broken-backed snake
      that's been trodden on I was myself!&quot;</p>
      <p>She clung to him suddenly. She had not wanted to start all this again.
      Yet some perversity had made her.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you're not now,&quot; she said. &quot;You're not that now: a
      broken-backed snake that's been trodden on.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know what I am. There's black days ahead.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No!&quot; she protested, clinging to him. &quot;Why? Why?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;There's black days coming for us all and for everybody,&quot; he
      repeated with a prophetic gloom.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! You're not to say it!&quot;</p>
      <p>He was silent. But she could feel the black void of despair inside him.
      That was the death of all desire, the death of all love: this despair that
      was like the dark cave inside the men, in which their spirit was lost.</p>
      <p>&quot;And you talk so coldly about sex,&quot; she said. &quot;You talk
      as if you had only wanted your own pleasure and satisfaction.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was protesting nervously against him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay!&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to have my pleasure and
      satisfaction of a woman, and I never got it: because I could never get my
      pleasure and satisfaction of <i>her</i> unless she got hers of me at the
      same time. And it never happened. It takes two.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you never believed in your women. You don't even believe
      really in me,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know what believing in a woman means.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;That's it, you see!&quot;</p>
      <p>She still was curled on his lap. But his spirit was grey and absent, he
      was not there for her. And everything she said drove him further.</p>
      <p>&quot;But what <i>do</i> you believe in?&quot; she insisted.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Nothing, like all the men I've ever known,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>They were both silent. Then he roused himself and said:</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, I do believe in something. I believe in being warmhearted. I
      believe especially in being warm-hearted in love, in fucking with a warm
      heart. I believe if men could fuck with warm hearts, and the women take it
      warm-heartedly, everything would come all right. It's all this
      cold-hearted fucking that is death and idiocy.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you don't fuck me cold-heartedly,&quot; she protested.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't want to fuck you at all. My heart's as cold as cold
      potatoes just now.&quot;</p>
