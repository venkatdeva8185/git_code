 <p>&quot;One never should keep these things,&quot; said Connie. &quot;That
      one shouldn't! One should never have them made!&quot;</p>
      <p>He broke the cardboard photograph and mount over his knee, and when it
      was small enough, put it on the fire.</p>
      <p>&quot;It'll spoil the fire though,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>The glass and the backboard he carefully took upstairs.</p>
      <p>The frame he knocked asunder with a few blows of the hammer, making the
      stucco fly. Then he took the pieces into the scullery.</p>
      <p>&quot;We'll burn that tomorrow,&quot; he said. &quot;There's too much
      plaster-moulding on it.&quot;</p>
      <p>Having cleared away, he sat down.</p>
      <p>&quot;Did you love your wife?&quot; she asked him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Love?&quot; he said. &quot;Did you love Sir Clifford?&quot;</p>
      <p>But she was not going to be put off.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you cared for her?&quot; she insisted.</p>
      <p>&quot;Cared?&quot; He grinned.</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps you care for her now,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Me!&quot; His eyes widened. &quot;Ah no, I can't think of
      her,&quot; he said quietly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
      <p>But he shook his head.</p>
      <p>&quot;Then why don't you get a divorce? She'll come back to you one
      day,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>He looked up at her sharply.</p>
      <p>&quot;She wouldn't come within a mile of me. She hates me a lot worse
      than I hate her.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You'll see she'll come back to you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;That she never will. That's done! It would make me sick to see
      her.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You will see her. And you're not even legally separated, are
      you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah well, then she'll come back, and you'll have to take her
      in.&quot;</p>
      <p>He gazed at Connie fixedly. Then he gave the queer toss of his head.</p>
      <p>&quot;You might be right. I was a fool ever to come back here. But I
      felt stranded and had to go somewhere. A man's a poor bit of a wastrel
      blown about. But you're right. I'll get a divorce and get clear. I hate
      those things like death, officials and courts and judges. But I've got to
      get through with it. I'll get a divorce.&quot;</p>
      <p>And she saw his jaw set. Inwardly she exulted. &quot;I think I will
      have a cup of tea now,&quot; she said.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>He rose to make it. But his face was set. As they sat at table she
      asked him:</p>
      <p>&quot;Why did you marry her? She was commoner than yourself. Mrs.
      Bolton told me about her. She could never understand why you married
      her.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her fixedly.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll tell you,&quot; he said. &quot;The first girl I had, I began
      with when I was sixteen. She was a school-master's daughter over at
      Ollerton, pretty, beautiful really. I was supposed to be a clever sort of
      young fellow from Sheffield Grammar School, with a bit of French and
      German, very much up aloft. She was the romantic sort that hated
      commonness. She egged me on to poetry and reading: in a way, she made a
      man of me. I read and I thought like a house on fire, for her. And I was a
      clerk in Butterley offices, thin, white-faced fellow fuming with all the
      things I read. And about <i>everything</i> I talked to her: but
      everything. We talked ourselves into Persepolis and Timbuctoo. We were the
      most literary-cultured couple in ten counties. I held forth with rapture
      to her, positively with rapture. I simply went up in smoke. And she adored
      me. The serpent in the grass was sex. She somehow didn't have any; at
      least, not where it's supposed to be. I got thinner and crazier. Then I
      said we'd got to be lovers. I talked her into it, as usual. So she let me.
      I was excited, and she never wanted it. She just didn't want it. She
      adored me, she loved me to talk to her and kiss her: in that way she had a
      passion for me. But the other, she just didn't want. And there are lots of
      women like her. And it was just the other that I did want. So there we
      split. I was cruel, and left her. Then I took on with another girl, a
      teacher, who had made a scandal by carrying on with a married man and
      driving him nearly out of his mind. She was a soft, white-skinned, soft
      sort of a woman, older than me, and played the fiddle. And she was a
      demon. She loved everything about love, except the sex. Clinging,
      caressing, creeping into you in every way: but if you forced her to the
      sex itself, she just ground her teeth and sent out hate. I forced her to
      it, and she could simply numb me with hate because of it. So I was balked
      again. I loathed all that. I wanted a woman who wanted me, and wanted <i>it</i>.</p>
