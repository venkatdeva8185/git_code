 <p>&quot;I'm not going to enter any new bondages.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't boast, while the gods are listening,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>She pulled up short.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! I won't boast!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>But she was thrilled, none the less, to be going off: to feel bonds
      snap. She couldn't help it.</p>
      <p>Clifford, who couldn't sleep, gambled all night with Mrs. Bolton, till
      she was too sleepy almost to live.</p>
      <p>And the day came round for Hilda to arrive. Connie had arranged with
      Mellors that if everything promised well for their night together, she
      would hang a green shawl out of the window. If there were frustration, a
      red one.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton helped Connie to pack.</p>
      <p>&quot;It will be so good for your Ladyship to have a change.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I think it will. You don't mind having Sir Clifford on your hands
      alone for a time, do you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh no! I can manage him quite all right. I mean, I can do all he
      needs me to do. Don't you think he's better than he used to be?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh much! You do wonders with him.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do I though! But men are all alike: just babies, and you have to
      flatter them and wheedle them and let them think they're having their own
      way. Don't you find it so, my Lady?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm afraid I haven't much experience.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie paused in her occupation.</p>
      <p>&quot;Even your husband, did you have to manage him, and wheedle him
      like a baby?&quot; she asked, looking at the other woman.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton paused too.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well!&quot; she said. &quot;I had to do a good bit of coaxing,
      with him too. But he always knew what I was after, I must say that. But he
      generally gave in to me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;He was never the lord and master thing?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! At least there'd be a look in his eyes sometimes, and then I
      knew <i>I'd</i> got to give in. But usually he gave in to me. No, he was
      never lord and master. But neither was I. I knew when I could go no
      further with him, and then I gave in: though it cost me a good bit,
      sometimes.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And what if you had held out against him?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I don't know, I never did. Even when he was in the wrong, if
      he was fixed, I gave in. You see, I never wanted to break what was between
      us. And if you really set your will against a man, that finishes it. If
      you care for a man, you have to give in to him once he's really
      determined; whether you're in the right or not, you have to give in. Else
      you break something. But I must say, Ted 'ud give in to me sometimes, when
      I was set on a thing, and in the wrong. So I suppose it cuts both
      ways.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And that's how you are with all your patients?&quot; asked
      Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, That's different. I don't care at all, in the same way. I
      know what's good for them, or I try to, and then I just contrive to manage
      them for their own good. It's not like anybody as you're really fond of.
      It's quite different. Once you've been really fond of a man, you can be
      affectionate to almost any man, if he needs you at all. But it's not the
      same thing. You don't really <i>care</i>. I doubt, once you've <i>really</i>
      cared, if you can ever really care again.&quot;</p>
      <p>These words frightened Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you think one can only care once?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Or never. Most women never care, never begin to. They don't know
      what it means. Nor men either. But when I see a woman as cares, my heart
      stands still for her.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And do you think men easily take offence?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! If you wound them on their pride. But aren't women the same?
      Only our two prides are a bit different.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie pondered this. She began again to have some misgiving about her
      gag away. After all, was she not giving her man the go-by, if only for a
      short time? And he knew it. That's why he was so queer and sarcastic.</p>
      <p>Still! the human existence is a good deal controlled by the machine of
      external circumstance. She was in the power of this machine. She couldn't
      extricate herself all in five minutes. She didn't even want to.</p>
      <p>Hilda arrived in good time on Thursday morning, in a nimble two-seater
      car, with her suit-case strapped firmly behind. She looked as demure and
      maidenly as ever, but she had the same will of her own. She had the very
      hell of a will of her own, as her husband had found out. But the husband
      was now divorcing her.&nbsp; Yes, she even made it easy for him to do
      that, though she had no lover. For the time being, she was 'off' men. She
      was very well content to be quite her own mistress: and mistress of her
      two children, whom she was going to bring up 'properly', whatever that may
      mean.</p>
      <p>Connie was only allowed a suit-case, also. But she had sent on a trunk
      to her father, who was going by train. No use taking a car to Venice. And
      Italy much too hot to motor in, in July. He was going comfortably by
      train. He had just come down from Scotland.</p>
      <p>So, like a demure arcadian field-marshal, Hilda arranged the material
      part of the journey. She and Connie sat in the upstairs room, chatting.</p>
      <p>&quot;But Hilda!&quot; said Connie, a little frightened. &quot;I want
      to stay near here tonight. Not here: near here!&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda fixed her sister with grey, inscrutable eyes. She seemed so calm:
      and she was so often furious.</p>
      <p>&quot;Where, near here?&quot; she asked softly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, you know I love somebody, don't you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I gathered there was something.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well he lives near here, and I want to spend this last night with
      him must! I've promised.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie became insistent.</p>
      <p>Hilda bent her Minerva-like head in silence. Then she looked up.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you want to tell me who he is?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;He's our game-keeper,&quot; faltered Connie, and she flushed
      vividly, like a shamed child.</p>
      <p>&quot;Connie!&quot; said Hilda, lifting her nose slightly with disgust:
      a she had from her mother.</p>
      <p>&quot;I know: but he's lovely really. He really understands
      tenderness,&quot; said Connie, trying to apologize for him.</p>
      <p>Hilda, like a ruddy, rich-coloured Athena, bowed her head and pondered
      She was really violently angry. But she dared not show it, because Connie,
      taking after her father, would straight away become obstreperous and
      unmanageable.</p>
      <p>It was true, Hilda did not like Clifford: his cool assurance that he
      was somebody! She thought he made use of Connie shamefully and impudently.
      She had hoped her sister <i>would</i> leave him. But, being solid Scotch
      middle class, she loathed any &quot;lowering' of oneself or the family.
      She looked up at last.</p>
