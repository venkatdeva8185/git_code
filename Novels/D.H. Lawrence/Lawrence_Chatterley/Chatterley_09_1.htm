 <p>Connie was surprised at her own feeling of aversion from Clifford. What
      is more, she felt she had always really disliked him. Not hate: there was
      no passion in it. But a profound physical dislike. Almost, it seemed to
      her, she had married him because she disliked him, in a secret, physical
      sort of way. But of course, she had married him really because in a mental
      way he attracted her and excited her. He had seemed, in some way, her
      master, beyond her.</p>
      <p>Now the mental excitement had worn itself out and collapsed, and she
      was aware only of the physical aversion. It rose up in her from her
      depths: and she realized how it had been eating her life away.</p>
      <p>She felt weak and utterly forlorn. She wished some help would come from
      outside. But in the whole world there was no help. Society was terrible
      because it was insane. Civilized society is insane. Money and so-called
      love are its two great manias; money a long way first. The individual
      asserts himself in his disconnected insanity in these two modes: money and
      love. Look at Michaelis! His life and activity were just insanity. His
      love was a sort of insanity.</p>
      <p>And Clifford the same. All that talk! All that writing! All that wild
      struggling to push himself forwards! It was just insanity. And it was
      getting worse, really maniacal.</p>
      <p>Connie felt washed-out with fear. But at least, Clifford was shifting
      his grip from her on to Mrs. Bolton. He did not know it. Like many insane
      people, his insanity might be measured by the things he was <i>not</i>
      aware of the great desert tracts in his consciousness.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton was admirable in many ways. But she had that queer sort of
      bossiness, endless assertion of her own will, which is one of the signs of
      insanity in modern woman. She <i>thought</i> she was utterly subservient
      and living for others. Clifford fascinated her because he always, or so of
      ten, frustrated her will, as if by a finer instinct. He had a finer,
      subtler will of self-assertion than herself. This was his charm for her.</p>
      <p>Perhaps that had been his charm, too, for Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's a lovely day, today!&quot; Mrs. Bolton would say in her
      caressive, persuasive voice. &quot;I should think you'd enjoy a little run
      in your chair today, the sun's just lovely.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes? Will you give me that book--there, that yellow one. And I
      think I'll have those hyacinths taken out.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why they're so beautiful!&quot; She pronounced it with the 'y'
      sound: be-yutiful! &quot;And the scent is simply gorgeous.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The scent is what I object to,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a little
      funereal.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you think so!&quot; she exclaimed in surprise, just a little
      offended, but impressed. And she carried the hyacinths out of the room,
      impressed by his higher fastidiousness.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall I shave you this morning, or would you rather do it
      yourself?&quot; Always the same soft, caressive, subservient, yet managing
      voice.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know. Do you mind waiting a while. I'll ring when I'm
      ready.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Very good, Sir Clifford!&quot; she replied, so soft and
      submissive, withdrawing quietly. But every rebuff stored up new energy of
      will in her.</p>
      <p>When he rang, after a time, she would appear at once. And then he would
      say:</p>
      <p>&quot;I think I'd rather you shaved me this morning.&quot;</p>
      <p>Her heart gave a little thrill, and she replied with extra softness:</p>
      <p>&quot;Very good, Sir Clifford!&quot;</p>
      <p>She was very deft, with a soft, lingering touch, a little slow. At
      first he had resented the infinitely soft touch of her lingers on his
      face. But now he liked it, with a growing voluptuousness. He let her shave
      him nearly every day: her face near his, her eyes so very concentrated,
      watching that she did it right. And gradually her fingertips knew his
      cheeks and lips, his jaw and chin and throat perfectly. He was well-fed
      and well-liking, his face and throat were handsome enough and he was a
      gentleman.</p>
      <p>She was handsome too, pale, her face rather long and absolutely still,
      her eyes bright, but revealing nothing. Gradually, with infinite softness,
      almost with love, she was getting him by the throat, and he was yielding
      to her.</p>
      <p>She now did almost everything for him, and he felt more at home with
      her, less ashamed of accepting her menial offices, than with Connie. She
      liked handling him. She loved having his body in her charge, absolutely,
      to the last menial offices. She said to Connie one day: &quot;All men are
      babies, when you come to the bottom of them. Why, I've handled some of the
      toughest customers as ever went down Tevershall pit. But let anything ail
      them so that you have to do for them, and they're babies, just big babies.
      Oh, there's not much difference in men!&quot;</p>
      <p>At first Mrs. Bolton had thought there really was something different
      in a gentleman, a <i>real</i> gentleman, like Sir Clifford. So Clifford
      had got a good start of her. But gradually, as she came to the bottom of
      him, to use her own term, she found he was like the rest, a baby grown to
      man's proportions: but a baby with a queer temper and a fine manner and
      power in its control, and all sorts of odd knowledge that she had never
      dreamed of, with which he could still bully her.</p>
      <p>Connie was sometimes tempted to say to him:</p>
      <p>&quot;For God's sake, don't sink so horribly into the hands of that
      woman!&quot; But she found she didn't care for him enough to say it, in
      the long run.</p>
      <p>It was still their habit to spend the evening together, till ten
      o'clock. Then they would talk, or read together, or go over his
      manuscript. But the thrill had gone out of it. She was bored by his
      manuscripts. But she still dutifully typed them out for him. But in time
      Mrs. Bolton would do even that.</p>
      <p>For Connie had suggested to Mrs. Bolton that she should learn to use a
      typewriter. And Mrs. Bolton, always ready, had begun at once, and
      practised assiduously. So now Clifford would sometimes dictate a letter to
      her, and she would take it down rather slowly, but correctly. And he was
      very patient, spelling for her the difficult words, or the occasional
      phrases in French. She was so thrilled, it was almost a pleasure to
      instruct her.</p>
      <p>Now Connie would sometimes plead a headache as an excuse for going up
      to her room after dinner.</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps Mrs. Bolton will play piquet with you,&quot; she said to
      Clifford.</p>
