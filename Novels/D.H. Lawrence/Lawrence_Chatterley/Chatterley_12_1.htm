 <p>Connie went to the wood directly after lunch. It was really a lovely
      day, the first dandelions making suns, the first daisies so white. The
      hazel thicket was a lace-work, of half-open leaves, and the last dusty
      perpendicular of the catkins. Yellow celandines now were in crowds, flat
      open, pressed back in urgency, and the yellow glitter of themselves. It
      was the yellow, the powerful yellow of early summer. And primroses were
      broad, and full of pale abandon, thick-clustered primroses no longer shy.
      The lush, dark green of hyacinths was a sea, with buds rising like pale
      corn, while in the riding the forget-me-nots were fluffing up, and
      columbines were unfolding their ink-purple ruches, and there were bits of
      blue bird's eggshell under a bush. Everywhere the bud-knots and the leap
      of life!</p>
      <p>The keeper was not at the hut. Everything was serene, brown chickens
      running lustily. Connie walked on towards the cottage, because she wanted
      to find him.</p>
      <p>The cottage stood in the sun, off the wood's edge. In the little garden
      the double daffodils rose in tufts, near the wide-open door, and red
      double daisies made a border to the path. There was the bark of a dog, and
      Flossie came running.</p>
      <p>The wide-open door! so he was at home. And the sunlight falling on the
      red-brick floor! As she went up the path, she saw him through the window,
      sitting at the table in his shirt-sleeves, eating. The dog wuffed softly,
      slowly wagging her tail.</p>
      <p>He rose, and came to the door, wiping his mouth with a red handkerchief
      still chewing.</p>
      <p>&quot;May I come in?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Come in!&quot;</p>
      <p>The sun shone into the bare room, which still smelled of a mutton chop,
      done in a dutch oven before the fire, because the dutch oven still stood
      on the fender, with the black potato-saucepan on a piece of paper, beside
      it on the white hearth. The fire was red, rather low, the bar dropped, the
      kettle singing.</p>
      <p>On the table was his plate, with potatoes and the remains of the chop;
      also bread in a basket, salt, and a blue mug with beer. The table-cloth
      was white oil-cloth, he stood in the shade.</p>
      <p>&quot;You are very late,&quot; she said. &quot;Do go on eating!&quot;</p>
      <p>She sat down on a wooden chair, in the sunlight by the door.</p>
      <p>&quot;I had to go to Uthwaite,'&quot; he said, sitting down at the
      table but not eating.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do eat,&quot; she said. But he did not touch the food.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall y'ave something?&quot; he asked her. &quot;Shall y'ave a
      cup of tea? t' kettle's on t' boil&quot;---he half rose again from his
      chair.</p>
      <p>&quot;If you'll let me make it myself,&quot; she said, rising. He
      seemed sad, and she felt she was bothering him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, tea-pot's in there&quot;---he pointed to a little, drab
      corner cupboard; &quot;an' cups. An' tea's on t' mantel ower yer 'ead,&quot;</p>
      <p>She got the black tea-pot, and the tin of tea from the mantel-shelf.
      She rinsed the tea-pot with hot water, and stood a moment wondering where
      to empty it.</p>
      <p>&quot;Throw it out,&quot; he said, aware of her. &quot;It's
      clean.&quot;</p>
      <p>She went to the door and threw the drop of water down the path. How
      lovely it was here, so still, so really woodland. The oaks were putting
      out ochre yellow leaves: in the garden the red daisies were like red plush
      buttons. She glanced at the big, hollow sandstone slab of the threshold,
      now crossed by so few feet.</p>
      <p>&quot;But it's lovely here,&quot; she said. &quot;Such a beautiful
      stillness, everything alive and still.&quot;</p>
      <p>He was eating again, rather slowly and unwillingly, and she could feel
      he was discouraged. She made the tea in silence, and set the tea-pot on
      the hob, as she knew the people did. He pushed his plate aside and went to
      the back place; she heard a latch click, then he came back with cheese on
      a plate, and butter.</p>
      <p>She set the two cups on the table; there were only two.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;Will you have a cup of tea?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;If you like. Sugar's in th' cupboard, an' there's a little cream
      jug. Milk's in a jug in th' pantry.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall I take your plate away?&quot; she asked him. He looked up
      at her with a faint ironical smile.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why. . .if you like,&quot; he said, slowly eating bread and
      cheese. She went to the back, into the pent-house scullery, where the pump
      was. On the left was a door, no doubt the pantry door. She unlatched it,
      and almost smiled at the place he called a pantry; a long narrow
      white-washed slip of a cupboard. But it managed to contain a little barrel
      of beer, as well as a few dishes and bits of food. She took a little milk
      from the yellow jug.</p>
      <p>&quot;How do you get your milk?&quot; she asked him, when she came back
      to the table.</p>
      <p>&quot;Flints! They leave me a bottle at the warren end. You know, where
      I met you!&quot;</p>
      <p>But he was discouraged. She poured out the tea, poising the cream-jug.</p>
      <p>&quot;No milk,&quot; he said; then he seemed to hear a noise, and
      looked keenly through the doorway.</p>
      <p>&quot;'Appen we'd better shut,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;It seems a pity,&quot; she replied. &quot;Nobody will come, will
      they?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Not unless it's one time in a thousand, but you never know.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And even then it's no matter,&quot; she said. &quot;It's only a
      cup of tea. Where are the spoons?&quot;</p>
      <p>He reached over, and pulled open the table drawer. Connie sat at the
      table in the sunshine of the doorway.</p>
      <p>&quot;Flossie!&quot; he said to the dog, who was lying on a little mat
      at the stair foot. &quot;Go an' hark, hark!&quot;</p>
      <p>He lifted his finger, and his &quot;hark!&quot; was very vivid. The dog
      trotted out to reconnoitre.</p>
      <p>&quot;Are you sad today?&quot; she asked him.</p>
      <p>He turned his blue eyes quickly, and gazed direct on her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Sad! no, bored! I had to go getting summonses for two poachers I
      caught, and, oh well, I don't like people.&quot;</p>
      <p>He spoke cold, good English, and there was anger in his voice. &quot;Do
      you hate being a game-keeper?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Being a game-keeper, no! So long as I'm left alone. But when I
      have to go messing around at the police-station, and various other places,
      and waiting for a lot of fools to attend to me. . .oh well, I get mad. .
      .&quot; and he smiled, with a certain faint humour.</p>
      <p>&quot;Couldn't you be really independent?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Me? I suppose I could, if you mean manage to exist on my pension.
      I could! But I've got to work, or I should die. That is, I've got to have
      something that keeps me occupied. And I'm not in a good enough temper to
      work for myself. It's got to be a sort of job for somebody else, or I
      should throw it up in a month, out of bad temper. So altogether I'm very
      well off here, especially lately. . .&quot;</p>
