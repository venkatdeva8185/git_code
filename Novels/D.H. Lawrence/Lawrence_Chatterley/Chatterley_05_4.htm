 <p>So it seemed to her everywhere. The colliers at Tevershall were talking
      again of a strike, and it seemed to Connie there again it was not a
      manifestation of energy, it was the bruise of the war that had been in
      abeyance, slowly rising to the surface and creating the great ache of
      unrest, and stupor of discontent. The bruise was deep, deep, deep...the
      bruise of the false inhuman war. It would take many years for the living
      blood of the generations to dissolve the vast black clot of bruised blood,
      deep inside their souls and bodies. And it would need a new hope.</p>
      <p>Poor Connie! As the years drew on it was the fear of nothingness In her
      life that affected her. Clifford's mental life and hers gradually began to
      feel like nothingness. Their marriage, their integrated life based on a
      habit of intimacy, that he talked about: there were days when it all
      became utterly blank and nothing. It was words, just so many words. The
      only reality was nothingness, and over it a hypocrisy of words.</p>
      <p>There was Clifford's success: the bitch-goddess! It was true he was
      almost famous, and his books brought him in a thousand pounds. His
      photograph appeared everywhere. There was a bust of him in one of the
      galleries, and a portrait of him in two galleries. He seemed the most
      modern of modern voices. With his uncanny lame instinct for publicity, he
      had become in four or five years one of the best known of the young
      &quot;intellectuals&quot;. Where the intellect came in, Connie did not
      quite see. Clifford was really clever at that slightly humorous analysis
      of people and motives which leaves everything in bits at the end. But it
      was rather like puppies tearing the sofa cushions to bits; except that it
      was not young and playful, but curiously old, and rather obstinately
      conceited. It was weird and it was nothing. This was the feeling that
      echoed and re-echoed at the bottom of Connie's soul: it was all flag, a
      wonderful display of nothingness; At the same time a display. A display! a
      display! a display!</p>
      <p>Michaelis had seized upon Clifford as the central figure for a play;
      already he had sketched in the plot, and written the first act. For
      Michaelis was even better than Clifford at making a display of
      nothingness. It was the last bit of passion left in these men: the passion
      for making a display. Sexually they were passionless, even dead. And now
      it was not money that Michaelis was after. Clifford had never been
      primarily out for money, though he made it where he could, for money is
      the seal and stamp of success. And success was what they wanted. They
      wanted, both of them, to make a real display. . .a man's own very display
      of himself that should capture for a time the vast populace.</p>
      <p>It was strange. . .the prostitution to the bitch-goddess. To Connie,
      since she was really outside of it, and since she had grown numb to the
      thrill of it, it was again nothingness. Even the prostitution to the
      bitch-goddess was nothingness, though the men prostituted themselves
      innumerable times. Nothingness even that.</p>
      <p>Michaelis wrote to Clifford about the play. Of course she knew about it
      long ago. And Clifford was again thrilled. He was going to be displayed
      again this time, somebody was going to display him, and to advantage. He
      invited Michaelis down to Wragby with Act I.</p>
      <p>Michaelis came: in summer, in a pale-coloured suit and white suede
      gloves, with mauve orchids for Connie, very lovely, and Act I was a great
      success. Even Connie was thrilled. . .thrilled to what bit of marrow she
      had left. And Michaelis, thrilled by his power to thrill, was really
      wonderful. . .and quite beautiful, in Connie's eyes. She saw in him that
      ancient motionlessness of a race that can't be disillusioned any more, an
      extreme, perhaps, of impurity that is pure. On the far side of his supreme
      prostitution to the bitch-goddess he seemed pure, pure as an African ivory
      mask that dreams impurity into purity, in its ivory curves and planes.</p>
      <p>His moment of sheer thrill with the two Chatterleys, when he simply
      carried Connie and Clifford away, was one of the supreme moments of
      Michaelis' life. He had succeeded: he had carried them away. Even Clifford
      was temporarily in love with him. . .if that is the way one can put it.</p>
      <p>So next morning Mick was more uneasy than ever; restless, devoured,
      with his hands restless in his trousers pockets. Connie had not visited
      him in the night. . .and he had not known where to find her. Coquetry!. .
      .at his moment of triumph.</p>
      <p>He went up to her sitting-room in the morning. She knew he would come.
      And his restlessness was evident. He asked her about his play. . .did she
      think it good? He <i>had</i> to hear it praised: that affected him with
      the last thin thrill of passion beyond any sexual orgasm. And she praised
      it rapturously. Yet all the while, at the bottom of her soul, she knew it
      was nothing.</p>
      <p>&quot;Look here!&quot; he said suddenly at last. &quot;Why don't you
      and I make a clean thing of it? Why don't we marry?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But I am married,&quot; she said, amazed, and yet feeling
      nothing.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh that!. . .he'll divorce you all right. . .Why don't you and I
      marry? I want to marry. I know it would be the best thing for me. . .marry
      and lead a regular life. I lead the deuce of a life, simply tearing myself
      to pieces. Look here, you and I, we're made for one another. . .hand and
      glove. Why don't we marry? Do you see any reason why we shouldn't?&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie looked at him amazed: and yet she felt nothing. These men, they
      were all alike, they left everything out. They just went off from the top
      of their heads as if they were squibs, and expected you to be carried
      heavenwards along with their own thin sticks.</p>
      <p>&quot;But I am married already,&quot; she said. &quot;I can't leave
      Clifford, you know.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why not? but why not?&quot; he cried. &quot;He'll hardly know
      you've gone, after six months. He doesn't know that anybody exists, except
      himself. Why the man has no use for you at all, as far as I can see; he's
      entirely wrapped up in himself.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie felt there was truth in this. But she also felt that Mick was
      hardly making a display of selflessness.</p>
      <p>&quot;Aren't all men wrapped up in themselves?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, more or less, I allow. A man's got to be, to get through. But
      that's not the point. The point is, what sort of a time can a man give a
      woman? Can he give her a damn good time, or can't he? If he can't he's no
      right to the woman...' He paused and gazed at her with his full, hazel
      eyes, almost hypnotic. `Now I consider,' he added, `I can give a woman the
      darndest good time she can ask for. I think I can guarantee myself.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And what sort of a good time?&quot; asked Connie, gazing on him
      still with a sort of amazement, that looked like thrill; and underneath
      feeling nothing at all.</p>
      <p>&quot;Every sort of a good time, damn it, every sort! Dress, jewels up
      to a point, any nightclub you like, know anybody you want to know, live
      the pace. . .travel and be somebody wherever you go. . .Darn it, every
      sort of good time.&quot;</p>
