 <p>He looked back at her. She saw his eyes, tense and brilliant, fierce,
      not loving. But her will had left her. A strange weight was on her limbs.
      She was giving way. She was giving up.</p>
      <p>He led her through the wall of prickly trees, that were difficult to
      come through, to a place where was a little space and a pile of dead
      boughs. He threw one or two dry ones down, put his coat and waistcoat over
      them, and she had to lie down there under the boughs of the tree, like an
      animal, while he waited, standing there in his shirt and breeches,
      watching her with haunted eyes. But still he was provident---he made her
      lie properly, properly. Yet he broke the band of her underclothes, for she
      did not help him, only lay inert.</p>
      <p>He too had bared the front part of his body and she felt his naked
      flesh against her as he came into her. For a moment he was still inside
      her, turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move, in the sudden
      helpless orgasm, there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside
      her. Rippling, rippling, rippling, like a flapping overlapping of soft
      flames, soft as feathers, running to points of brilliance, exquisite,
      exquisite and melting her all molten inside. It was like bells rippling up
      and up to a culmination. She lay unconscious of the wild little cries she
      uttered at the last. But it was over too soon, too soon, and she could no
      longer force her own conclusion with her own activity. This was different,
      different. She could do nothing. She could no longer harden and grip for
      her own satisfaction upon him. She could only wait, wait and moan in
      spirit as she felt him withdrawing, withdrawing and contracting, coming to
      the terrible moment when he would slip out of her and be gone. Whilst all
      her womb was open and soft, and softly clamouring, like a sea-anemone
      under the tide, clamouring for him to come in again and make a fulfilment
      for her. She clung to him unconscious iii passion, and he never quite
      slipped from her, and she felt the soft bud of him within her stirring,
      and strange rhythms flushing up into her with a strange rhythmic growing
      motion, swelling and swelling till it filled all her cleaving
      consciousness, and then began again the unspeakable motion that was not
      really motion, but pure deepening whirlpools of sensation swirling deeper
      and deeper through all her tissue and consciousness, till she was one
      perfect concentric fluid of feeling, and she lay there crying in
      unconscious inarticulate cries. The voice out of the uttermost night, the
      life! The man heard it beneath him with a kind of awe, as his life sprang
      out into her. And as it subsided, he subsided too and lay utterly still,
      unknowing, while her grip on him slowly relaxed, and she lay inert. And
      they lay and knew nothing, not even of each other, both lost. Till at last
      he began to rouse and become aware of his defenceless nakedness, and she
      was aware that his body was loosening its clasp on her. He was coming
      apart; but in her breast she felt she could not bear him to leave her
      uncovered. He must cover her now for ever.</p>
      <p>But he drew away at last, and kissed her and covered her over, and
      began to cover himself She lay looking up to the boughs of the tree,
      unable as yet to move. He stood and fastened up his breeches, looking
      round. All was dense and silent, save for the awed dog that lay with its
      paws against its nose. He sat down again on the brushwood and took
      Connie's hand in silence.</p>
      <p>She turned and looked at him. --- &quot;We came off together that
      time,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>She did not answer.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's good when it's like that. Most folks live their lives
      through and they never know it,&quot; he said, speaking rather dreamily.</p>
      <p>She looked into his brooding face.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do they?&quot; she said. &quot;Are you glad?&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked back into her eyes. &quot;Glad,&quot; he said, &quot;Ay, but
      never mind.&quot; He did not want her to talk. And he bent over her and
      kissed her, and she felt, so he must kiss her for ever.</p>
      <p>At last she sat up.</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't people often come off together?&quot; she asked with naive
      curiosity.</p>
      <p>&quot;A good many of them never. You can see by the raw look of
      them.&quot; He spoke unwittingly, regretting he had begun.</p>
      <p>&quot;Have you come off like that with other women?&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her amused.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
      <p>And she knew he would never tell her anything he didn't want to tell
      her. She watched his face, and the passion for him moved in her bowels.
      She resisted it as far as she could, for it was the loss of herself to
      herself.</p>
      <p>He put on his waistcoat and his coat, and pushed a way through to the
      path again.</p>
      <p>The last level rays of the sun touched the wood.---&quot;I won't come
      with you,&quot; he said; &quot;better not.&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked at him wistfully before she turned. His dog was waiting so
      anxiously for him to go, and he seemed to have nothing whatever to say.
      Nothing left.</p>
      <p>Connie went slowly home, realizing the depth of the other thing in her.
      Another self was alive in her, burning molten and soft in her womb and
      bowels, and with this self she adored him. She adored him till her knees
      were weak as she walked. In her womb and bowels she was flowing and alive
      now and vulnerable, and helpless in adoration of him as the most naive
      woman.---It feels like a child, she said to herself it feels like a child
      in me.---And so it did, as if her womb, that had always been shut, had
      opened and filled with new life, almost a burden, yet lovely.</p>
      <p>&quot;If I had a child!&quot; she thought to herself; &quot;if I had
      him inside me as a child!&quot;---and her limbs turned molten at the
      thought, and she realized the immense difference between having a child to
      oneself and having a child to a man whom one's bowels yearned towards. The
      former seemed in a sense ordinary: but to have a child to a man whom one
      adored in one's bowels and one's womb, it made her feel she was very
      different from her old self and as if she was sinking deep, deep to the
      centre of all womanhood and the sleep of creation.</p>
      <p>It was not the passion that was new to her, it was the yearning
      adoration. She knew she had always feared it, for it left her helpless;
      she feared it still, lest if she adored him too much, then she would lose
      herself become effaced, and she did not want to be effaced, a slave, like
      a savage woman. She must not become a slave. She feared her adoration, yet
      she would not at once fight against it. She knew she could fight it. She
      had a devil of self-will in her breast that could have fought the full
      soft heaving adoration of her womb and crushed it. She could even now do
      it, or she thought so, and she could then take up her passion with her own
      will.</p>
