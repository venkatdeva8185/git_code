&quot;Why, yes, of course, it would wear Lady Chatterley out! It's a
      mercy she had a sister to come and help her. Men don't think, high and
      low-alike, they take what a woman does for them for granted. Oh, I've told
      the colliers off about it many a time. But it's very hard for Sir
      Clifford, you know, crippled like that. They were always a haughty family,
      standoffish in a way, as they've a right to be. But then to be brought
      down like that! And it's very hard on Lady Chatterley, perhaps harder on
      her. What she misses! I only had Ted three years, but my word, while I had
      him I had a husband I could never forget. He was one in a thousand, and
      jolly as the day. Who'd ever have thought he'd get killed? I don't believe
      it to this day somehow, I've never believed it, though I washed him with
      my own hands. But he was never dead for me, he never was. I never took it
      in.&quot;</p>
      <p>This was a new voice in Wragby, very new for Connie to hear; it roused
      a new ear in her.</p>
      <p>For the first week or so, Mrs. Bolton, however, was very quiet at
      Wragby, her assured, bossy manner left her, and she was nervous. With
      Clifford she was shy, almost frightened, and silent. He liked that, and
      soon recovered his self-possession, letting her do things for him without
      even noticing her.</p>
      <p>&quot;She's a useful nonentity!&quot; he said. Connie opened her eyes
      in wonder, but she did not contradict him. So different are impressions on
      two different people!</p>
      <p>And he soon became rather superb, somewhat lordly with the nurse. She
      had rather expected it, and he played up without knowing. So susceptible
      we are to what is expected of us! The colliers had been so like children,
      talking to her, and telling her what hurt them, while she bandaged them,
      or nursed them. They had always made her feel so grand, almost super-human
      in her administrations. Now Clifford made her feel small, and like a
      servant, and she accepted it without a word, adjusting herself to the
      upper classes.</p>
      <p>She came very mute, with her long, handsome face, and downcast eyes, to
      administer to him. And she said very humbly: &quot;Shall I do this now,
      Sir Clifford? Shall I do that?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, leave it for a time. I'll have it done later.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Very well, Sir Clifford.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Come in again in half an hour.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Very well, Sir Clifford.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And just take those old papers out, will you?&quot;</p>
      <p>`Very well, Sir Clifford.'</p>
      <p>She went softly, and in half an hour she came softly again. She was
      bullied, but she didn't mind. She was experiencing the upper classes. She
      neither resented nor disliked Clifford; he was just part of a phenomenon,
      the phenomenon of the high-class folks, so far unknown to her, but now to
      be known. She felt more at home with Lady Chatterley, and after all it's
      the mistress of the house matters most.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton helped Clifford to bed at night, and slept across the
      passage from his room, and came if he rang for her in the night. She also
      helped him in the morning, and soon valeted him completely, even shaving
      him, in her soft, tentative woman's way. She was very good and competent,
      and she soon knew how to have him in her power. He wasn't so very
      different from the colliers after all, when you lathered his chin, and
      softly rubbed the bristles. The stand-offishness and the lack of frankness
      didn't bother her; she was having a new experience.</p>
      <p>Clifford, however, inside himself, never quite forgave Connie for
      giving up her personal care of him to a strange hired woman. It killed, he
      said to himself, the real flower of the intimacy between him and her. But
      Connie didn't mind that. The fine flower of their intimacy was to her
      rather like an orchid, a bulb stuck parasitic on her tree of life, and
      producing, to her eyes, a rather shabby flower.</p>
      <p>Now she had more time to herself she could softly play the piano, up in
      her room, and sing: &quot;Touch not the nettle. . . for the bonds of love
      are ill to loose.&quot; She had not realized till lately how ill to loose
      they were, these bonds of love. But thank Heaven she had loosened them!
      She was so glad to be alone, not always to have to talk to him. When he
      was alone he tapped-tapped-tapped on a typewriter, to infinity. But when
      he was not &quot;working&quot;, and she was there, he talked, always
      talked; infinite small analysis of people and motives, and results,
      characters and personalities, till now she had had enough. For years she
      had loved it, until she had enough, and then suddenly it was too much. She
      was thankful to be alone.</p>
      <p>It was as if thousands and thousands of little roots and threads of
      consciousness in him and her had grown together into a tangled mass, till
      they could crowd no more, and the plant was dying. Now quietly, subtly,
      she was unraveling the tangle of his consciousness and hers, breaking the
      threads gently, one by one, with patience and impatience to get clear. But
      the bonds of such love are more ill to loose even than most bonds; though
      Mrs. Bolton's coming had been a great help.</p>
      <p>But he still wanted the old intimate evenings of talk with Connie: talk
      or reading aloud. But now she could arrange that Mrs. Bolton should come
      at ten to disturb them. At ten o'clock Connie could go upstairs and be
      alone. Clifford was in good hands with Mrs. Bolton.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton ate with Mrs. Betts in the housekeeper's room, since they
      were all agreeable. And it was curious how much closer the servants'
      quarters seemed to have come; right up to the doors of Clifford's study,
      when before they were so remote. For Mrs. Betts would sometimes sit in
      Mrs. Bolton's room, and Connie heard their lowered voices, and felt
      somehow the strong, other vibration of the working people almost invading
      the sitting-room, when she and Clifford were alone. So changed was Wragby
      merely by Mrs. Bolton's coming.</p>
      <p>And Connie felt herself released, in another world, she felt she
      breathed differently. But still she was afraid of how many of her roots,
      perhaps mortal ones, were tangled with Clifford's. Yet still, she breathed
      freer, a new phase was going to begin in her life.</p>
