 <p>Connie wore her goggles and disguising cap, and she sat in silence.
      Because of Hilda's Opposition, she was fiercely on the sidle of the man,
      she would stand by him through thick and thin.</p>
      <p>They had their head-lights on, by the time they passed Crosshill, and
      the small lit-up train that chuffed past in the cutting made it seem like
      real night. Hilda had calculated the turn into the lane at the bridge-end.
      She slowed up rather suddenly and swerved off the road, the lights glaring
      white into the grassy, overgrown lane. Connie looked out. She saw a
      shadowy figure, and she opened the door.</p>
      <p>&quot;Here we are!&quot; she said softly.</p>
      <p>But Hilda had switched off the lights, and was absorbed backing, making
      the turn.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nothing on the bridge?&quot; she asked shortly. &quot;You're all
      right,&quot; said the mall's voice. She backed on to the bridge, reversed,
      let the car run forwards a few yards along the road, then backed into the
      lane, under a wych-elm tree, crushing the grass and bracken. Then all the
      lights went out. Connie stepped down. The man stood under the trees.</p>
      <p>&quot;Did you wait long?&quot; Connie asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Not so very,&quot; he replied.</p>
      <p>They both waited for Hilda to get out. But Hilda shut the door of the
      car and sat tight.</p>
      <p>&quot;This is my sister Hilda. Won't you come and speak to her? Hilda!
      This is Mr Mellors.&quot;</p>
      <p>The keeper lifted his hat, but went no nearer.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do walk down to the cottage with us, Hilda,&quot; Connie pleaded.
      &quot;It's not far.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What about the car?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;People do leave them on the lanes. You have the key.&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda was silent, deliberating. Then she looked backwards down the
      lane.</p>
      <p>&quot;Can I back round the bush?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh yes!&quot; said the keeper.</p>
      <p>She backed slowly round the curve, out of sight of the road, locked the
      car, and got down. It was night, but luminous dark. The hedges rose high
      and wild, by the unused lane, and very dark seeming. There was a fresh
      sweet scent on the air. The keeper went ahead, then came Connie, then
      Hilda, and in silence. He lit up the difficult places with a flash-light
      torch, and they went on again, while an owl softly hooted over the oaks,
      and Flossie padded silently around. Nobody could speak. There was nothing
      to say.</p>
      <p>At length Connie saw the yellow light of the house, and her heart beat
      fast. She was a little frightened. They trailed on, still in Indian file.</p>
      <p>He unlocked the door and preceded them into the warm but bare little
      room. The fire burned low and red in the grate. The table was set with two
      plates and two glasses on a proper white table-cloth for Once. Hilda shook
      her hair and looked round the bare, cheerless room. Then she summoned her
      courage and looked at the man.</p>
      <p>He was moderately tall, and thin, and she thought him good-looking. He
      kept a quiet distance of his own, and seemed absolutely unwilling to
      speak.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do sit down, Hilda,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do!&quot; he said. &quot;Can I make you tea or anything, or will
      you drink a glass of beer? It's moderately cool.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Beer!&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Beer for me, please!&quot; said Hilda, with a mock sort of
      shyness. He looked at her and blinked.</p>
      <p>He took a blue jug and tramped to the scullery. When he came back with
      the beer, his face had changed again.</p>
      <p>Connie sat down by the door, and Hilda sat in his seat, with the back
      to the wall, against the window corner.</p>
      <p>&quot;That is his chair,&quot; said Connie softly. And Hilda rose as if
      it had burnt her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Sit yer still, sit yer still! Ta'e ony cheer as yo'n a mind to,
      none of us is th' big bear,&quot; he said, with complete equanimity.</p>
      <p>And he brought Hilda a glass, and poured her beer first from the blue
      jug.</p>
      <p>&quot;As for cigarettes,&quot; he said, &quot;I've got none, but 'appen
      you've got your own. I dunna smoke, mysen. Shall y' eat summat?' He turned
      direct to Connie. `Shall t'eat a smite o' summat, if I bring it thee? Tha
      can usually do wi' a bite.&quot; He spoke the vernacular with a curious
      calm assurance, as if he were the landlord of the Inn.</p>
      <p>&quot;What is there?&quot; asked Connie, flushing.</p>
      <p>&quot;Boiled ham, cheese, pickled wa'---nuts, if yer like.---Nowt
      much.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Connie. &quot;Won't you, Hilda?&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda looked up at him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why do you speak Yorkshire?&quot; she said softly.</p>
      <p>&quot;That! That's non Yorkshire, that's Derby.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked back at her with that faint, distant grin.</p>
      <p>&quot;Derby, then! Why do you speak Derby? You spoke natural English at
      first.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Did Ah though? An' canna Ah change if Ah'm a mind to 't? Nay,
      nay, let me talk Derby if it suits me. If yo'n nowt against it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;It sounds a little affected,&quot; said Hilda.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, 'appen so! An' up i' Tevershall yo'd sound affected.&quot; He
      looked again at her, with a queer calculating distance, along his
      cheek-bone: as if to say: Yi, an' who are you?</p>
      <p>He tramped away to the pantry for the food.</p>
      <p>The sisters sat in silence. He brought another plate, and knife and
      fork. Then he said:</p>
      <p>&quot;An' if it's the same to you, I s'll ta'e my coat off like I
      allers do.&quot;</p>
      <p>And he took off his coat, and hung it on the peg, then sat down to
      table in his shirt-sleeves: a shirt of thin, cream-coloured flannel.</p>
      <p>&quot;'elp yerselves!&quot; he said. &quot;'elp yerselves! Dunna wait
      f'r axin'!&quot;</p>
      <p>He cut the bread, then sat motionless. Hilda felt, as Connie once used
      to, his power of silence and distance. She saw his smallish, sensitive,
      loose hand on the table. He was no simple working man, not he: he was
      acting! acting!</p>
      <p>&quot;Still!' she said, as she took a little cheese. &quot;It would be
      more natural if you spoke to us in normal English, not in
      vernacular.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her, feeling her devil of a will.</p>
      <p>&quot;Would it?&quot; he said in the normal English. &quot;Would it?
      Would anything that was said between you and me be quite natural, unless
      you said you wished me to hell before your sister ever saw me again: and
      unless I said something almost as unpleasant back again? Would anything
      else be natural?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh yes!&quot; said Hilda. &quot;Just good manners would be quite
      natural.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Second nature, so to speak!&quot; he said: then he began to
      laugh. &quot;Nay,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm weary o' manners. Let me
      be!&quot;</p>
