 <p>He spoke it almost in a brilliancy of triumph, and Connie looked at him
      as if dazzled, and really feeling nothing at all. Hardly even the surface
      of her mind was tickled at the glowing prospects he offered her. Hardly
      even her most outside self responded, that at any other time would have
      been thrilled. She just got no feeling from it, she couldn't &quot;go
      off&quot;. She just sat and stared and looked dazzled, and felt nothing,
      only somewhere she smelt the extraordinarily unpleasant smell of the
      bitch-goddess.</p>
      <p>Mick sat on tenterhooks, leaning forward in his chair, glaring at her
      almost hysterically: and whether he was more anxious out of vanity for her
      to say Yes! or whether he was more panic-stricken for fear she <i>should </i>say
      Yes!--who can tell?</p>
      <p>&quot;I should have to think about it,&quot; she said. &quot;I couldn't
      say now. It may seem to you Clifford doesn't count, but he does. When you
      think how disabled he is. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh damn it all! If a fellow's going to trade on his disabilities,
      I might begin to say how lonely I am, and always have been, and all the
      rest of the my-eye-Betty-Martin sob-stuff! Damn it all, if a fellow's got
      nothing but disabilities to recommend him. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>He turned aside, working his hands furiously in his trousers pockets.
      That evening he said to her:</p>
      <p>&quot;You're coming round to my room tonight, aren't you? I don't darn
      know where your room is.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;All right!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>He was a more excited lover that night, with his strange, small boy's
      frail nakedness. Connie found it impossible to come to her crisis before
      he had really finished his. And he roused a certain craving passion in
      her, with his little boy's nakedness and softness; she had to go on after
      he had finished, in the wild tumult and heaving of her loins, while he
      heroically kept himself up, and present in her, with all his will and
      self-offering, till she brought about her own crisis, with weird little
      cries.</p>
      <p>When at last he drew away from her, he said, in a bitter, almost
      sneering little voice:</p>
      <p>&quot;You couldn't go off at the same time as a man, could you? You'd
      have to bring yourself off! You'd have to run the show!&quot;</p>
      <p>This little speech, at the moment, was one of the shocks of her life.
      Because that passive sort of giving himself was so obviously his only real
      mode of intercourse.</p>
      <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;You know what I mean. You keep on for hours after I've gone
      off...and I have to hang on with my teeth till you bring yourself off by
      your own exertions.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was stunned by this unexpected piece of brutality, at the moment
      when she was glowing with a sort of pleasure beyond words, and a sort of
      love for him. Because, after all, like so many modern men, he was finished
      almost before he had begun. And that forced the woman to be active.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you want me to go on, to get my own satisfaction?&quot; she
      said.</p>
      <p>He laughed grimly: `I want it!' he said. `That's good! I want to hang
      on with my teeth clenched, while you go for me!'</p>
      <p>&quot;But don't you?&quot; she insisted.</p>
      <p>He avoided the question. &quot;All the darned women are like
      that,&quot; he said. &quot;Either they don't go off at all, as if they
      were dead in there. . .or else they wait till a chap's really done, and
      then they start in to bring themselves off, and a chap's got to hang on. I
      never had a woman yet who went off just at the same moment as I did.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie only half heard this piece of novel, masculine information. She
      was only stunned by his feeling against her. . .his incomprehensible
      brutality. She felt so innocent.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you want me to have my satisfaction too, don't you?&quot; she
      repeated.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, all right! I'm quite willing. But I'm darned if hanging on
      waiting for a woman to go off is much of a game for a man. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>This speech was one of the crucial blows of Connie's life. It killed
      something in her. She had not been so very keen on Michaelis; till he
      started it, she did not want him. It was as if she never positively wanted
      him. But once he had started her, it seemed only natural for her to come
      to her own crisis with him. Almost she had loved him for it. . .almost
      that night she loved him, and wanted to marry him.</p>
      <p>Perhaps instinctively he knew it, and that was why he had to bring down
      the whole show with a smash; the house of cards. Her whole sexual feeling
      for him, or for any man, collapsed that night. Her life fell apart from
      his as completely as if he had never existed.</p>
      <p>And she went through the days drearily. There was nothing now but this
      empty treadmill of what Clifford called the integrated life, the long
      living together of two people, who are in the habit of being in the same
      house with one another.</p>
      <p>Nothingness! To accept the great nothingness of life seemed to be the
      one end of living. All the many busy and important little things that make
      up the grand sum-total of nothingness!</p>
