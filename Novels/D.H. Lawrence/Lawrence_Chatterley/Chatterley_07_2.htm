 <p>There were people staying in the house, among them Clifford's Aunt Eva,
      Lady Bennerley. She was a thin woman of sixty, with a red nose, a widow,
      and still something of a &quot;grande dame&quot;<i>.</i> She belonged to
      one of the best families, and had the character to carry it off. Connie
      liked her, she was so perfectly simple and [rank, as far as she intended
      to be frank, and superficially kind. Inside herself she was a
      past-mistress in holding her own, and holding other people a little lower.
      She was not at all a snob: far too sure of herself. She was perfect at the
      social sport of coolly holding her own, and making other people defer to
      her.</p>
      <p>She was kind to Connie, and tried to worm into her woman's soul with
      the sharp gimlet of her well-born observations.</p>
      <p>&quot;You're quite wonderful, in my opinion,&quot; she said to Connie.
      &quot;You've done wonders for Clifford. I never saw any budding genius
      myself, and there he is, all the rage.&quot; -- Aunt Eva was quite
      complacently proud of Clifford's success. Another feather in the family
      cap! She didn't care a straw about his books, but why should she?</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I don't think it's my doing,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;It must be! Can't be anybody else's. And it seems to me you don't
      get enough out of it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Look at the way you are shut up here. I said to Clifford: If that
      child rebels one day you'll have yourself to thank!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But Clifford never denies me anything,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Look here, my dear child&quot;--and Lady Bennerley laid her thin
      hand on Connie's arm. &quot;A woman has to live her life, or live to
      repent not having lived it. Believe me!&quot; And she took another sip of
      brandy, which maybe was her form of repentance.</p>
      <p>&quot;But I do live my life, don't I?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Not in my idea! Clifford should bring you to London, and let you
      go about. His sort of friends are all right for him, but what are they for
      you? If I were you I should think it wasn't good enough. You'll let your
      youth slip by, and you'll spend your old age, and your middle age too,
      repenting it.&quot;</p>
      <p>Her ladyship lapsed into contemplative silence, soothed by the brandy.</p>
      <p>But Connie was not keen on going to London, and being steered into the
      smart world by Lady Bennerley. She didn't feel really smart, it wasn't
      interesting. And she did feel the peculiar, withering coldness under it
      all; like the soil of Labrador, which his gay little flowers on its
      surface, and a foot down is frozen.</p>
      <p>Tommy Dukes was at Wragby, and another man, Harry Winterslow, and Jack
      Strangeways with his wife Olive. The talk was much more desultory than
      when only the cronies were there, and everybody was a bit bored, for the
      weather was bad, and there was only billiards, and the pianola to dance
      to.</p>
      <p>Olive was reading a book about the future, when babies would be bred in
      bottles, and women would be &quot;immunized&quot;.</p>
      <p>&quot;Jolly good thing too!&quot; she said. `Then a woman can live her
      own life.' Strangeways wanted children, and she didn't.</p>
      <p>&quot;How'd you like to be immunized?&quot; Winterslow asked her, with
      an ugly smile.</p>
      <p>&quot;I hope I am; naturally,&quot; she said. &quot;Anyhow the future's
      going to have more sense, and a woman needn't be dragged down by her <i>functions</i>.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps she'll float off into space altogether,&quot; said Dukes.</p>
      <p>&quot;I do think sufficient civilization ought to eliminate a lot of
      the physical disabilities,&quot; said Clifford. &quot;All the
      love-business for example, it might just as well go. I suppose it would if
      we could breed babies in bottles.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No!&quot; cried Olive. &quot;That might leave all the more room
      for fun.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Lady Bennerley, contemplatively, &quot;if
      the love-business went, something else would take its place. Morphia,
      perhaps. A little morphine in all the air. It would be wonderfully
      refreshing for everybody.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The government releasing ether into the air on Saturdays, for a
      cheerful weekend!&quot; said Jack. &quot;Sounds all right, but where
      should we be by Wednesday?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;So long as you can forget your body you are happy,&quot; said
      Lady Bennerley. &quot;And the moment you begin to be aware of your body,
      you are wretched. So, if civilization is any good, it has to help us to
      forget our bodies, and then time passes happily without our knowing
      it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Help us to get rid of our bodies altogether,&quot; said
      Winterslow. &quot;It's quite time man began to improve on his own nature,
      especially the physical side of it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Imagine if we floated like tobacco smoke,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;It won't happen,&quot; said Dukes. &quot;Our old show will come
      flop; our civilization is going to fall. It's going down the bottomless
      pit, down the chasm. And believe me, the only bridge across the chasm will
      be the phallus!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh do! <i>do</i> be impossible, General!&quot; cried Olive.</p>
      <p>&quot;I believe our civilization is going to collapse,&quot; said Aunt
      Eva.</p>
      <p>&quot;And what will come after it?&quot; asked Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;I haven't the faintest idea, but something, I suppose,&quot; said
      the elderly lady.</p>
      <p>&quot;Connie says people like wisps of smoke, and Olive says immunized
      women, and babies in bottles, and Dukes says the phallus is the bridge to
      what comes next. I wonder what it will really be?&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, don't bother! let's get on with today,&quot; said Olive.
      &quot;Only hurry up with the breeding bottle, and let us poor women
      off.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;There might even be real men, in the next phase,&quot; said
      Tommy. &quot;Real, intelligent, wholesome men, and wholesome nice women!
      Wouldn't that be a change, an enormous change from us? <i>We're</i> not
      men, and the women aren't women. We're only cerebrating make-shifts,
      mechanical and intellectual experiments. There may even come a
      civilization of genuine men and women, instead of our little lot of
      clever-jacks, all at the intelligence-age of seven. It would be even more
      amazing than men of smoke or babies in bottles.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, when people begin to talk about real women, I give up,&quot;
      said Olive.</p>
      <p>&quot;Certainly nothing but the spirit in us is worth having,&quot;
      said Winterslow.</p>
      <p>&quot;Spirits!&quot; said Jack, drinking his whisky and soda.</p>
      <p>&quot;Think so? Give me the resurrection of the body!&quot; said Dukes.&nbsp;
      &quot;But it'll come, in time, when we've shoved the cerebral stone away a
      bit, the money and the rest. Then we'll get a democracy of touch, instead
      of a democracy of pocket.&quot;</p>
      <p>Something echoed inside Connie: &quot;Give me the democracy of touch,
      the resurrection of the body!&quot; She didn't at all know what it meant,
      but it comforted her, as meaningless things may do.</p>
      <p>Anyhow everything was terribly silly, and she was exasperatedly bored
      by it all, by Clifford, by Aunt Eva, by Olive and Jack, and Winterslow,
      and even by Dukes. Talk, talk, talk! What hell it was, the continual
      rattle of it!</p>
