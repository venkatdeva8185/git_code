 <p>When I hear Mrs. Bolton talk, I feel myself plunging down, down, to the
      depths where the fish of human secrets wriggle and swim. Carnal appetite
      makes one seize a beakful of prey: then up, up again, out of the dense
      into the ethereal, from the wet into the dry. To you I can tell the whole
      process. But with Mrs. Bolton I only feel the downward plunge, down,
      horribly, among the sea-weeds and the pallid monsters of the very bottom.</p>
      <p>I am afraid we are going to lose our game-keeper. The scandal of the
      truant wife, instead of dying down, has reverberated to greater and
      greater dimensions. He is accused of all unspeakable things and curiously
      enough, the woman has managed to get the bulk of the colliers' wives
      behind her, gruesome fish, and the village is putrescent with talk.</p>
      <p>I hear this Bertha Coutts besieges Mellors in his mother's house,
      having ransacked the cottage and the hut. She seized one day upon her own
      daughter, as that chip of the female block was returning from school; but
      the little one, instead of kissing the loving mother's hand, bit it
      firmly, and so received from the other hand a smack in the face which sent
      her reeling into the gutter: whence she was rescued by an indignant and
      harassed grandmother.</p>
      <p>The woman has blown off an amazing quantity of poison-gas. She has
      aired in detail all those incidents of her conjugal life which are usually
      buried down in the deepest grave of matrimonial silence, between married
      couples. Having chosen to exhume them, after ten years of burial, she has
      a weird array. I hear these details from Linley and the doctor: the latter
      being amused. Of course there is really nothing in it. Humanity has always
      had a strange avidity for unusual sexual postures, and if a man likes to
      use his wife, as Benvenuto Cellini says, `in the Italian way', well that
      is a matter of taste. But I had hardly expected our game-keeper to be up
      to so many tricks. No doubt Bertha Coutts herself first put him up to
      them. In any case, it is a matter of their own personal squalor, and
      nothing to do with anybody else.</p>
      <p>However, everybody listens: as I do myself. A dozen years ago, common
      decency would have hushed the thing. But common decency no longer exists,
      and the colliers' wives are all up in arms and unabashed in voice. One
      would think every child in Tevershall, for the last fifty years, had been
      an immaculate conception, and every one of our nonconformist females was a
      shining Joan of Arc. That our estimable game-keeper should have about him
      a touch of Rabelais seems to make him more monstrous and shocking than a
      murderer like Crippen. Yet these people in Tevershall are a loose lot, if
      one is to believe all accounts.</p>
      <p>The trouble is, however, the execrable Bertha Coutts has not confined
      herself to her own experiences and sufferings. She has discovered, at the
      top of her voice, that her husband has been `keeping' women down at the
      cottage, and has made a few random shots at naming the women. This has
      brought a few decent names trailing through the mud, and the thing has
      gone quite considerably too far. An injunction has been taken out against
      the woman.</p>
      <p>I have had to interview Mellors about the business, as it was
      impossible to keep the woman away from the wood. He goes about as usual,
      with his Miller-of-the-Dee air, I care for nobody, no not I, if nobody
      care for me! Nevertheless, I shrewdly suspect he feels like a dog with a
      tin can tied to its tail: though he makes a very good show of pretending
      the tin can isn't there. But I heard that in the village the women call
      away their children if he is passing, as if he were the Marquis de Sade in
      person. He goes on with a certain impudence, but I am afraid the tin can
      is firmly tied to his tail, and that inwardly he repeats, like Don Rodrigo
      in the Spanish ballad: `Ah, now it bites me where I most have sinned!'</p>
      <p>I asked him if he thought he would be able to attend to his duty in the
      wood, and he said he did not think he had neglected it. I told him it was
      a nuisance to have the woman trespassing: to which he replied that he had
      no power to arrest her. Then I hinted at the scandal and its unpleasant
      course. `Ay,' he said. `folks should do their own fuckin', then they
      wouldn't want to listen to a lot of clatfart about another man's.'</p>
      <p>He said it with some bitterness, and no doubt it contains the real germ
      of truth. The mode of putting it, however, is neither delicate nor
      respectful. I hinted as much, and then I heard the tin can rattle again.
      `It's not for a man the shape you're in, Sir Clifford, to twit me for
      havin' a cod atween my legs.'</p>
      <p>These things, said indiscriminately to all and sundry, of course do not
      help him at all, and the rector, and Finley, and Burroughs all think it
      would be as well if the man left the place.</p>
      <p>I asked him if it was true that he entertained ladies down at the
      cottage, and all he said was: `Why, what's that to you, Sir Clifford?' I
      told him I intended to have decency observed on my estate, to which he
      replied: `Then you mun button the mouths o' a' th' women.'--When I pressed
      him about his manner of life at the cottage, he said: `Surely you might
      ma'e a scandal out o' me an' my bitch Flossie. You've missed summat
      there.' As a matter of fact, for an example of impertinence he'd be hard
      to beat.</p>
      <p>I asked him fit would be easy for him to find another job. He said: 'If
      you're hintin' that you'd like to shunt me out of this job, it'd be easy
      as wink.' So he made no trouble at all about leaving at the end of next
      week, and apparently is willing to initiate a young fellow, Joe Chambers,
      into as many mysteries of the craft as possible. I told him I would give
      him a month's wages extra, when he left. He said he'd rather I kept my
      money, as I'd no occasion to ease my conscience. I asked him what he
      meant, and he said: 'You don't owe me nothing extra, Sir Clifford, so
      don't pay me nothing extra. If you think you see my shirt hanging out,
      just tell me.'</p>
      <p>Well, there is the end of it for the time being. The woman has gone
      away: we don't know where to: but she is liable to arrest if she shows her
      face in Tevershall. And I heard she is mortally afraid of gaol, because
      she merits it so well. Mellors will depart on Saturday week, and the place
      will soon become normal again.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, my dear Connie, if you would enjoy to stay in Venice or in
      Switzerland till the beginning of August, I should be glad to think you
      were out of all this buzz of nastiness, which will have died quite away by
      the end of the month.</p>
      <p>So you see, we arc deep-sea monsters, and when the lobster walks on
      mud, he stirs it up for everybody. We must perforce take it
      philosophically.&quot;---</p>
