 <p>Connie was in love with him, but she managed to sit with her embroidery
      and let the men talk, and not give herself away. As for Michaelis, he was
      perfect; exactly the same melancholic, attentive, aloof young fellow of
      the previous evening, millions of degrees remote from his hosts, but
      laconically playing up to them to the required amount, and never coming
      forth to them for a moment. Connie felt he must have forgotten the
      morning. He had not forgotten. But he knew where he was. . .in the same
      old place outside, where the born outsiders are. He didn't take the
      love-making altogether personally. He knew it would not change him from an
      ownerless dog, whom everybody begrudges its golden collar, into a
      comfortable society dog.</p>
      <p>The final fact being that at the very bottom of his soul he <i>was </i>an
      outsider, and anti-social, and he accepted the fact inwardly, no matter
      how Bond-Streety he was on the outside. His isolation was a necessity to
      him; just as the appearance of conformity and mixing-in with the smart
      people was also a necessity.</p>
      <p>But occasional love, as a comfort arid soothing, was also a good thing,
      and he was not ungrateful. On the contrary, he was burningly, poignantly
      grateful for a piece of natural, spontaneous kindness: almost to tears.
      Beneath his pale, immobile, disillusioned face, his child's soul was
      sobbing with gratitude to the woman, and burning to come to her again;
      just as his outcast soul was knowing he would keep really clear of her.</p>
      <p>He found an opportunity to say to her, as they were lighting the
      candles in the hall:</p>
      <p>&quot;May I come?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll come to you,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, good!&quot;</p>
      <p>He waited for her a long time. . .but she came.</p>
      <p>He was the trembling excited sort of lover, whose crisis soon came, and
      was finished. There was something curiously childlike and defenceless
      about his naked body: as children are naked. His defences were all in his
      wits and cunning, his very instincts of cunning, and when these were in
      abeyance he seemed doubly naked and like a child, of unfinished, tender
      flesh, and somehow struggling helplessly.</p>
      <p>He roused in the woman a wild sort of compassion and yearning, and a
      wild, craving physical desire. The physical desire he did not satisfy in
      her; he was always come and finished so quickly, then shrinking down on
      her breast, and recovering somewhat his effrontery while she lay dazed,
      disappointed, lost.</p>
      <p>But then she soon learnt to hold him, to keep him there inside her when
      his crisis was over. And there he was generous and curiously potent; he
      stayed firm inside her, giving to her, while she was active. . .wildly,
      passionately active, coming to her own crisis. And as he felt the frenzy
      of her achieving her own orgasmic satisfaction from his hard, erect
      passivity, he had a curious sense of pride and satisfaction.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah, how good!&quot; she whispered tremulously, and she became
      quite still, clinging to him. And he lay there in his own isolation, but
      somehow proud.</p>
      <p>He stayed that time only the three days, and to Clifford was exactly
      the same as on the first evening; to Connie also. There was no breaking
      down his external man.</p>
      <p>He wrote to Connie with the same plaintive melancholy note as ever,
      sometimes witty, and touched with a queer, sexless affection. A kind of
      hopeless affection he seemed to feel for her, and the essential remoteness
      remained the same. He was hopeless at the very core of him, and he wanted
      to be hopeless. He rather hated hope. <i>&quot;Une immense espérance a
      traversé la terre</i>&quot;, he read somewhere, and his comment
      was:&quot;--and it's darned-well drowned everything worth having.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie never really understood him, but, in her way, she loved him. And
      all the time she felt the reflection of his hopelessness in her. She
      couldn't quite, quite love in hopelessness. And he, being hopeless,
      couldn't ever quite love at all.</p>
      <p>So they went on for quite a time, writing, and meeting occasionally in
      London. She still wanted the physical, sexual thrill she could get with
      him by her own activity, his little orgasm being over. And he still wanted
      to give it her. Which was enough to keep them connected.</p>
      <p>And enough to give her a subtle sort of self-assurance, something blind
      and a little arrogant. It was an almost mechanical confidence in her own
      powers, and went with a great cheerfulness.</p>
      <p>She was terrifically cheerful at Wragby. And she used all her aroused
      cheerfulness and satisfaction to stimulate Clifford, so that he wrote his
      best at this time, and was almost happy in his strange blind way. He
      really reaped the fruits of the sensual satisfaction she got out of
      Michaelis' male passivity erect inside her. But of course he never knew
      it, and if he had, he wouldn't have said thank you!</p>
      <p>Yet when those days of her grand joyful cheerfulness and stimulus were
      gone, quite gone, and she was depressed and irritable, how Clifford longed
      for them again! Perhaps if he'd known he might even have wished to get her
      and Michaelis together again.</p>
