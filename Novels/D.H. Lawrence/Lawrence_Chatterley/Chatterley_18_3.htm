&quot;Ay!&quot; he said. &quot;You're right. It's that really. It's
      that all the way through. I knew it with the men. I had to be in touch
      with them, physically, and not go back on it. I had to be bodily aware of
      them and a bit tender to them, even if I put 'em through hell. It's a
      question of awareness, as Buddha said. But even he fought shy of the
      bodily awareness, and that natural physical tenderness, which is the best,
      even between men; in a proper manly way. Makes 'em really manly, not so
      monkeyish. Ay! it's tenderness, really; it's cunt-awareness. Sex is really
      only touch, the closest of all touch. And it's touch we're afraid of.
      We're only half-conscious, and half alive. We've got to come alive and
      aware. Especially the English have got to get into touch with one another,
      a bit delicate and a bit tender. It's our crying need.&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked at him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Then why are you afraid of me?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>He looked at her a long time before he answered.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's the money, really, and the position. It's the world in
      you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But isn't there tenderness in me?&quot; she said wistfully.</p>
      <p>He looked down at her, with darkened, abstract eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! It comes an' goes, like in me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But can't you trust it between you and me?&quot; she asked,
      gazing anxiously at him.</p>
      <p>She saw his face all softening down, losing its armour.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;Maybe!&quot; he said. They were both silent.</p>
      <p>&quot;I want you to hold me in your arms,&quot; she said. &quot;I want
      you to tell me you are glad we are having a child.&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked so lovely and warm and wistful, his bowels stirred towards
      her.</p>
      <p>&quot;I suppose we can go to my room,&quot; he said. &quot;Though it's
      scandalous again.&quot;</p>
      <p>But she saw the forgetfulness of the world coming over him again, his
      face taking the soft, pure look of tender passion.</p>
      <p>They walked by the remoter streets to Coburg Square, where he had a
      room at the top of the house, an attic room where he cooked for himself on
      a gas ring. It was small, but decent and tidy.</p>
      <p>She took off her things, and made him do the same. She was lovely in
      the soft first flush of her pregnancy.</p>
      <p>&quot;I ought to leave you alone,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;No!&quot; she said. &quot;Love me! Love me, and say you'll keep
      me. Say you'll keep me! Say you'll never let me go, to the world nor to
      anybody.&quot;</p>
      <p>She crept close against him, clinging fast to his thin, strong naked
      body, the only home she had ever known.</p>
      <p>&quot;Then I'll keep thee,&quot; he said. &quot;If tha wants it, then
      I'll keep thee.&quot;</p>
      <p>He held her round and fast.</p>
      <p>&quot;And say you're glad about the child,&quot; she repeated.</p>
      <p>&quot;Kiss it! Kiss my womb and say you're glad it's there.&quot;</p>
      <p>But that was more difficult for him.</p>
      <p>&quot;I've a dread of puttin' children i' th' world,&quot; he said.
      &quot;I've such a dread o' th' future for 'em.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you've put it into me. Be tender to it, and that will be its
      future already. Kiss it!&quot;</p>
      <p>He quivered, because it was true. &quot;Be tender to it, and that will
      be its future.&quot;---At that moment he felt a sheer love for the woman.
      He kissed her belly and her mound of Venus, to kiss close to the womb and
      the foetus within the womb.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, you love me! You love me!&quot; she said, in a little cry
      like one of her blind, inarticulate love cries. And he went in to her
      softly, feeling the stream of tenderness flowing in release from his
      bowels to hers, the bowels of compassion kindled between them.</p>
      <p>And he realized as he went into her that this was the thing he had to
      do, to e into tender touch, without losing his pride or his dignity or his
      integrity as a man. After all, if she had money and means, and he had
      none, he should be too proud and honourable to hold back his tenderness
      from her on that account. &quot;I stand for the touch of bodily awareness
      between human beings,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;and the touch of
      tenderness. And she is my mate. And it is a battle against the money, and
      the machine, and the insentient ideal monkeyishness of the world. And she
      will stand behind me there. Thank God I've got a woman! Thank God I've got
      a woman who is with me, and tender and aware of me. Thank God she's not a
      bully, nor a fool. Thank God she's a tender, aware woman.&quot; And as his
      seed sprang in her, his soul sprang towards her too, in the creative act
      that is far more than procreative.</p>
      <p>She was quite determined now that there should be no parting between
      him and her. But the ways and means were still to settle.</p>
      <p>&quot;Did you hate Bertha Coutts?&quot; she asked him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't talk to me about her.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! You must let me. Because once you liked her. And once you
      were as intimate with her as you are with me. So you have to tell me.
      Isn't it rather terrible, when you've been intimate with her, to hate her
      so? Why is it?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know. She sort of kept her will ready against me, always,
      always: her ghastly female will: her freedom! A woman's ghastly freedom
      that ends in the most beastly bullying! Oh, she always kept her freedom
      against me, like vitriol in my face.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But she's not free of you even now. Does she still love
      you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, no! If she's not free of me, it's because she's got that mad
      rage, she must try to bully me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But she must have loved you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! Well, in specks she did. She was drawn to me. And I think
      even that she hated. She loved me in moments. But she always took it back,
      and started bullying. Her deepest desire was to bully me, and there was no
      altering her. Her will was wrong, from the first.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But perhaps she felt you didn't really love her, and she wanted
      to make you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;My God, it was bloody making.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you didn't really love her, did you? You did her that
      wrong.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;How could I? I began to. I began to love her. But somehow, she
      always ripped me up. No, don't let's talk of it. It was a doom, that was.
      And she was a doomed woman. This last time, I'd have shot her like I shoot
      a stoat, if I'd but been allowed: a raving, doomed thing in the shape of a
      woman! If only I could have shot her, and ended the whole misery! It ought
      to be allowed. When a woman gets absolutely possessed by her own will, her
      own will set against everything, then it's fearful, and she should be shot
      at last.&quot;</p>
