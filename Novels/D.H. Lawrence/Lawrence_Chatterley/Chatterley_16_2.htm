 <p>&quot;At least,&quot; he said, subsiding, &quot;you'll be lucky if
      you've got off without a severe cold.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I haven't got a cold,&quot; she replied. She was thinking to
      herself of the other man's words: Tha's got the nicest woman's arse of
      anybody! She wished, she dearly wished she could tell Clifford that this
      had been said her, during the famous thunderstorm. However! She bore
      herself rather like an offended queen, and went upstairs to change.</p>
      <p>That evening, Clifford wanted to be nice to her. He was reading one of
      the latest scientific-religious books: he had a streak of a spurious sort
      of religion in him, and was egocentrically concerned with the future of
      his own ego. It was like his habit to make conversation to Connie about
      some book, since the conversation between them had to be made, almost
      chemically. They had almost chemically to concoct it in their heads.</p>
      <p>&quot;What do you think of this, by the way?&quot; he said, reaching
      for his book. &quot;You'd have no need to cool your ardent body by running
      out in the rain, if only we have a few more aeons of evolution behind us.
      Ah, here it is!---'The universe shows us two aspects: on one side it is
      physically wasting, on the other it is spiritually ascending.'''</p>
      <p>Connie listened, expecting more. But Clifford was waiting. She looked
      at him in surprise.</p>
      <p>&quot;And if it spiritually ascends,&quot; she said, &quot;what does it
      leave down below, in the place where its tail used to be?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he said. &quot;Take the man for what he means. <i>Ascending</i>
      is the opposite of his <i>wasting</i>, I presume.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Spiritually blown out, so to speak!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, but seriously, without joking: do you think there is anything
      in it?&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked at him again.</p>
      <p>&quot;Physically wasting?&quot; she said. &quot;I see you getting
      fatter, and I'm sot wasting myself. Do you think the sun is smaller than
      he used to be? He's not to me. And I suppose the apple Adam offered Eve
      wasn't really much bigger, if any, than one of our orange pippins. Do you
      think it was?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, hear how he goes on: 'It is thus slowly passing, with a
      slowness inconceivable in our measures of time, to new creative
      conditions, amid which the physical world, as we at present know it, will
      he represented by a ripple barely to be distinguished from nonentity'.''</p>
      <p>She listened with a glisten of amusement. All sorts of improper things
      suggested themselves. But she only said:</p>
      <p>&quot;What silly hocus-pocus! As if his little conceited consciousness
      could know what was happening as slowly as all that! It only means <i>he's</i>
      a physical failure on the earth, so he wants to make the whole universe a
      physical failure. Priggish little impertinence!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, but listen! Don't interrupt the great man's solemn
      words!---The present type of order in the world has risen from an
      unimaginable part, and will find its grave in an unimaginable future.
      There remains the inexhaustive realm of abstract forms, and creativity
      with its shifting character ever determined afresh by its own creatures,
      and God, upon whose wisdom all forms of order depend.---There, that's how
      he winds up!&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie sat listening contemptuously.</p>
      <p>&quot;He's spiritually blown out,&quot; she said. &quot;What a lot of
      stuff! Unimaginables, and types of order in graves, and realms of abstract
      forms, and creativity with a shifty character, and God mixed up with forms
      of order! Why, it's idiotic!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I must say, it is a little vaguely conglomerate, a mixture of
      gases, so to speak,&quot; said Clifford. &quot;Still, I think there is
      something in the idea that the universe is physically wasting and
      spiritually ascending.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you? Then let it ascend, so long as it leaves me safely and
      solidly physically here below.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you like your physique?&quot; he asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;I love it!&quot; And through her mind went the words: It's the
      nicest, nicest woman's arse as is!</p>
      <p>&quot;But that is really rather extraordinary, because there's no
      denying it's an encumbrance. But then I suppose a woman doesn't take a
      supreme pleasure in the life of the mind.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Supreme pleasure?&quot; she said, looking up at him. &quot;Is
      that sort of idiocy the supreme pleasure of the life of the mind? No thank
      you! Give me the body. I believe the life of the body is a greater reality
      than the life of the mind: when the body is really wakened to life. But so
      many people, like your famous wind-machine, have only got minds tacked on
      to their physical corpses.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her in wonder.</p>
      <p>&quot;The life of the body,&quot; he said, &quot;is just the life of
      the animals.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And that's better than the life of professional corpses. But it's
      not true! the human body is only just coming to real life. With the Greeks
      it gave a lovely flicker, then Plato and Aristotle killed it, and Jesus
      finished it off. But now the body is coming really to life, it is really
      rising from the tomb. And It will be a lovely, lovely life in the lovely
      universe, the life of the human body.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;My dear, you speak as if you were ushering it all in! True, you
      am going away on a holiday: but don't please be quite so indecently elated
      about it. Believe me, whatever God there is is slowly eliminating the guts
      and alimentary system from the human being, to evolve a higher, more
      spiritual being.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why should I believe you, Clifford, when I feel that whatever God
      there is has at last wakened up in my guts, as you call them, and is
      rippling so happily there, like dawn. Why should I believe you, when I
      feel so very much the contrary?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, exactly! And what has caused this extraordinary change in
      you? running out stark naked in the rain, and playing Bacchante? desire
      for sensation, or the anticipation of going to Venice?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Both! Do you think it is horrid of me to be so thrilled at going
      off?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Rather horrid to show it so plainly.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Then I'll hide it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, don't trouble! You almost communicate a thrill to me. I
      almost feel that it is <i>I</i> who am going off.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, why don't you come?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;We've gone over all that. And as a matter of fact, I suppose your
      greatest thrill comes from being able to say a temporary farewell to all
      this. Nothing so thrilling, for the moment, as Good-bye-to-all!---But
      every parting means a meeting elsewhere. And every meeting is a new
      bondage.&quot;</p>
