 <p>&quot;I should have thought sexual indigestion from surfeit would have
      interfered with you more seriously,&quot; said Hammond satirically.</p>
      <p>&quot;Not it! I don't over-eat myself and I don't over-fuck myself. One
      has a choice about eating too much. But you would absolutely starve
      me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Not at all! You can marry.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;How do you know I can? It may not suit the process of my mind.
      Marriage might. . .and would. . .stultify my mental processes. I'm not
      properly pivoted that way. . .and so must I be chained in a kennel like a
      monk? All rot and funk, my boy. I must live and do my calculations. I need
      women sometimes. I refuse to make a mountain of it, and I refuse anybody's
      moral condemnation or prohibition. I'd be ashamed to see a woman walking
      around with my name-label on her, address and railway station, like a
      wardrobe trunk.&quot;</p>
      <p>These two men had not forgiven each other about the Julia flirtation.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's an amusing idea, Charlie,&quot; said Dukes, &quot;that sex
      is just another form of talk, where you act the words instead of saying
      them. I suppose it's quite true. I suppose we might exchange as many
      sensations and emotions with women as we do ideas about the weather, and
      so on. Sex might be a sort of normal physical conversation between a man
      and a woman. You don't talk to a woman unless you have ideas in common:
      that is you don't talk with any interest. And in the same way, unless you
      had some emotion or sympathy in common with a woman you wouldn't sleep
      with her. But if you had. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;If you <i>have </i>the proper sort of emotion or sympathy with a
      woman, you <i>ought </i>to sleep with her,&quot; said May. &quot;It's the
      only decent thing, to go to bed with her. Just as, when you are interested
      talking to someone, the Only decent thing is to have the talk out. You
      don't prudishly put your tongue between your teeth and bite it. You just
      say out your say. And the same the other way.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Hammond. &quot;It's wrong. You, for example, May,
      you squander half your force with women. You'll never really do what you
      should do, with a fine mind such as yours. Too much of it goes the other
      way.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Maybe it does. . .and too little of you goes that way, Hammond,
      my boy, married or not. You can keep the purity and integrity of your
      mind, but it's going damned dry. Your pure mind is going as dry as
      fiddlesticks, from what I see of it. You're simply talking it down.&quot;</p>
      <p>Tommy Dukes burst into a laugh.</p>
      <p>&quot;Go it, you two minds!&quot; he said. &quot;Look at me. . .I don't
      do any high and pure mental work, nothing but jot down a few ideas. And
      yet I neither marry nor run after women. I think Charlie's quite right; if
      he wants to run after the women, he's quite free not to run too often. But
      I wouldn't prohibit him from running. As for Hammond, he's got a property
      instinct, so naturally the straight road and the narrow gate are right for
      him. You'll see he'll be an English Man of Letters before he's done. A. B.
      C. from top to toe. Then there's me. I'm nothing. Just a squib. And what
      about you, Clifford? Do you think sex is a dynamo to help a man on to
      success in the world?&quot;</p>
      <p>Clifford rarely talked much at these times. He never held forth; his
      ideas were really not vital enough for it, he was too confused and
      emotional. Now he blushed and looked uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well!&quot; he said, &quot;being myself <i>hors de combat, </i>I
      don't see I've anything to say on the matter.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Dukes; &quot;the top of you's by no means <i>hors
      de combat. </i>You've got the life of the mind sound and intact. So let us
      hear your ideas.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well,&quot; stammered Clifford, &quot;even then I don't suppose I
      have much idea. . .I suppose marry-and-have-done-with-it would pretty well
      stand for what I think. Though of course between a man and woman who care
      for one another, it is a great thing.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What sort of great thing?&quot; said Tommy.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh...it perfects the intimacy,&quot; said Clifford, uneasy as a
      woman in such talk.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, Charlie and I believe that sex is a sort of communication
      like speech. Let any woman start a sex conversation with me, and it's
      natural for me to go to bed with her to finish it, all in due season.
      Unfortunately no woman makes any particular start with me, so I go to bed
      by myself; and am none the worse for it. . .I hope so, anyway, for how
      should I know? Anyhow I've no starry calculations to be interfered with,
      and no immortal works to write. I'm merely a fellow skulking in the army.
      . .&quot;</p>
      <p>Silence fell. The four men smoked. And Connie sat there and put another
      stitch in her sewing. . .Yes, she sat there! She had to sit mum. She had
      to be quiet as a mouse, not to interfere with the immensely important
      speculations of these highly-mental gentlemen. But she had to be there.
      They didn't get on so well without her; their ideas didn't flow so freely.
      Clifford was much more hedgy and nervous, he got cold feet much quicker in
      Connie's absence, and the talk didn't run. Tommy Dukes came off best; he
      was a little inspired by her presence. Hammond she didn't really like; he
      seemed so selfish in a mental way. And Charles May, though she liked
      something about him, seemed a little distasteful and messy, in spite of
      his stars.</p>
      <p>How many evenings had Connie sat and listened to the manifestations of
      these four men! these, and one or two others. That they never seemed to
      get anywhere didn't trouble her deeply. She liked to hear what they had to
      say, especially when Tommy was there. It was fun. Instead of men kissing
      you, and touching you with their bodies, they revealed their minds to you.
      It was great fun! But what cold minds!</p>
      <p>And also it was a little irritating. She had more respect for Michaelis,
      on whose name they all poured such withering contempt, as a little mongrel
      arriviste, and uneducated bounder of the worst sort. Mongrel and bounder
      or not, he jumped to his own conclusions. He didn't merely walk round them
      with millions of words, in the parade of the life of the mind.</p>
      <p>Connie quite liked the life of the mind, and got a great thrill out of
      it. But she did think it overdid itself a little. She loved being there,
      amidst the tobacco smoke of those famous evenings of the cronies, as she
      called them privately to herself. She was infinitely amused, and proud
      too, that even their talking they could not do, without her silent
      presence. She had an immense respect for thought. . .and these men, at
      least, tried to think honestly. But somehow there was a cat, and it
      wouldn't jump. They all alike talked at something, though what it was, for
      the life of her she couldn't say. It was something that Mick didn't clear,
      either.</p>
