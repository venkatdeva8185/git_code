 <p>Clifford started the little engine, the man carefully turned the chair,
      and set it nose-forwards to the incline that curved gently to the dark
      hazel thicket.</p>
      <p>&quot;Is that all then, Sir Clifford?&quot; asked the man.</p>
      <p>&quot;No, you'd better come along in case she sticks. The engine isn't
      really strong enough for the uphill work.&quot; The man glanced round for
      his dog. . .a thoughtful glance. The spaniel looked at him and faintly
      moved its tail. A little smile, mocking or teasing her, yet gentle, came
      into his eyes for a moment, then faded away, and his face was
      expressionless. They went fairly quickly down the slope, the man with his
      hand on the rail of the chair, steadying it. He looked like a free soldier
      rather than a servant. And something about him reminded Connie of Tommy
      Dukes.</p>
      <p>When they came to the hazel grove, Connie suddenly ran forward, and
      opened the gate into the park. As she stood holding it, the two men looked
      at her in passing, Clifford critically, the other man with a curious, cool
      wonder; impersonally wanting to see what she looked like. And she saw in
      his blue, impersonal eyes a look of suffering and detachment, yet a
      certain warmth. But why was he so aloof, apart?</p>
      <p>Clifford stopped the chair, once through the gate, and the man came
      quickly, courteously, to close it.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why did you run to open?&quot; asked Clifford in his quiet, calm
      voice, that showed he was displeased. &quot;Mellors would have done
      it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I thought you would go straight ahead,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;And leave you to run after us?&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, well, I like to run sometimes!&quot;</p>
      <p>Mellors took the chair again, looking perfectly unheeding, yet Connie
      felt he noted everything. As he pushed the chair up the steepish rise of
      the knoll in the park, he breathed rather quickly, through parted lips. He
      was rather frail really. Curiously full of vitality, but a little frail
      and quenched. Her woman's instinct sensed it.</p>
      <p>Connie fell back, let the chair go on. The day had greyed over; the
      small blue sky that had poised low on its circular rims of haze was closed
      in again, the lid was down, there was a raw coldness. It was going to
      snow. All grey, all grey! the world looked worn out.</p>
      <p>The chair waited at the top of the pink path. Clifford looked round for
      Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Not tired, are you?&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>But she was. A strange, weary yearning, a dissatisfaction had started
      in her. Clifford did not notice: those were not things he was aware of.
      But the stranger knew. To Connie, everything in her world and life seemed
      worn out, and her dissatisfaction was older than the hills.</p>
      <p>They came to the house, and around to the back, where there were no
      steps. Clifford managed to swing himself over on to the low, wheeled
      house-chair; he was very strong and agile with his arms. Then Connie
      lifted the burden of his dead legs after him.</p>
      <p>The keeper, waiting at attention to be dismissed, watched everything
      narrowly, missing nothing. He went pale, with a sort of fear, when he saw
      Connie lifting the inert legs of the man in her arms, into the other
      chair, Clifford pivoting round as she did so. He was frightened.</p>
      <p>&quot;Thanks, then, for the help, Mellors,'&quot; said Clifford
      casually, as he began to wheel down the passage to the servants' quarters.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nothing else, Sir?&quot; came the neutral voice, like one in a
      dream.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nothing, good morning!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Good morning, Sir.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Good morning! it was kind of you to push the chair up that hill.
      . .I hope it wasn't heavy for you,&quot; said Connie, looking back at the
      keeper outside the door.</p>
      <p>His eyes came to hers in an instant, as if wakened up. He was aware of
      her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh no, not heavy!&quot; he said quickly. Then his voice dropped
      again into the broad sound of the vernacular: &quot;Good mornin' to your
      Ladyship!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Who is your game-keeper?&quot; Connie asked at lunch.</p>
      <p>&quot;Mellors! You saw him,&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, but where did he come from?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Nowhere! He was a Tevershall boy. . .son of a collier, I
      believe.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And was he a collier himself?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Blacksmith on the pit-bank, I believe: overhead smith. But he was
      keeper here for two years before the war. . .before he joined up. My
      father always had a good Opinion of him, so when he came back, and went to
      the pit for a blacksmith's job, I just took him back here as keeper. I was
      really very glad to get him. . .its almost impossible to find a good man
      round here for a gamekeeper. . .and it needs a man who knows the
      people.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And isn't he married?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;He was. But his wife went off with. . .with various men. . .but
      finally with a collier at Stacks Gate, and I believe she's living there
      still.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;So this man is alone?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;More or less! He has a mother in the village. . .and a child, I
      believe.&quot;</p>
      <p>Clifford looked at Connie, with his pale, slightly prominent blue eyes,
      in which a certain vagueness was coming. He seemed alert in the
      foreground, but the background was like the Midlands atmosphere, haze,
      smoky mist. And the haze seemed to be creeping forward. So when he stared
      at Connie in his peculiar way, giving her his peculiar, precise
      information, she felt all the background of his mind filling up with mist,
      with nothingness. And it frightened her. It made him seem impersonal,
      almost to idiocy.</p>
      <p>And dimly she realized one of the great laws of the human soul: that
      when the emotional soul receives a wounding shock, which does not kill the
      body, the soul seems to recover as the body recovers. But this is only
      appearance. It is really only the mechanism of the re-assumed habit.
      Slowly, slowly the wound to the soul begins to make itself felt, like a
      bruise, which only slowly deepens its terrible ache, till it fills all the
      psyche. And when we think we have recovered and forgotten, it is then that
      the terrible after-effects have to be encountered at their worst.</p>
      <p>So it was with Clifford. Once he was `well', once he was back at Wragby,
      and writing his stories, and feeling sure of life, in spite of all, he
      seemed to forget, and to have recovered all his equanimity. But now, as
      the years went by, slowly, slowly, Connie felt the bruise of fear and
      horror coming up, and spreading in him. For a time it had been so deep as
      to be numb, as it were non-existent. Now slowly it began to assert itself
      in a spread of fear, almost paralysis. Mentally he still was alert. But
      the paralysis, the bruise of the too-great shock, was gradually spreading
      in his affective self.</p>
      <p>And as it spread in him, Connie felt it spread in her. An inward dread,
      an emptiness, an indifference to everything gradually spread in her soul.
      When Clifford was roused, he could still talk brilliantly and, as it were,
      command the future: as when, in the wood, he talked about her having a
      child, and giving an heir to Wragby. But the day after, all the brilliant
      words seemed like dead leaves, crumpling up and turning to powder, meaning
      really nothing, blown away on any gust of wind. They were not the leafy
      words of an effective life, young with energy and belonging to the tree.
      They were the hosts of fallen leaves of a life that is ineffectual.</p>
