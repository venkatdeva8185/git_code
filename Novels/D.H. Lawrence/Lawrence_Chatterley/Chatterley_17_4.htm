 <p>She had been at Venice a fortnight, and she was to stay another ten
      days or a fortnight. The sunshine blazed over any count of time, and the
      fullness of physical health made forgetfulness complete. She was in a sort
      of stupor of well-being.</p>
      <p>From which a letter of Clifford roused her.</p>
      <p>&quot;We too have had our mild local excitement. It appears the truant
      wife of Mellors, the keeper, turned up at the cottage and found herself
      unwelcome. He packed her off, and locked the door. Report has it, however,
      that when he returned from the wood he found the no longer fair lady
      firmly established in his bed, in <i>puris naturalibus;</i> or one should
      say, in <i>impuris naturalibus.</i> She had broken a window and got in
      that way. Unable to evict the somewhat man-handled Venus from his couch,
      he beat a retreat and retired, it is said, to his mother's house in
      Tevershall. Meanwhile the Venus of Stacks Gate is established in the
      cottage, which she claims is her home, and Apollo, apparently, is
      domiciled in Tevershall.</p>
      <p>I repeat this from hearsay, as Mellors has not come to me personally. I
      had this particular bit of local garbage from our garbage bird, our ibis,
      our scavenging turkey-buzzard, Mrs. Bolton. I would not have repeated it
      had she not exclaimed: her Ladyship will go no more to the wood if <i>that
      </i>woman's going to be about!</p>
      <p>I like your picture of Sir Malcolm striding into the sea with white
      hair blowing and pink flesh glowing. I envy you that sun. Here it rains.
      But I don't envy Sir Malcolm his inveterate mortal carnality. However, it
      suits his age. Apparently one grows more carnal and more mortal as one
      grows older. Only youth has a taste of immortality,---&quot;</p>
      <p>This news affected Connie in her state of semi-stupefied ell being with
      vexation amounting to exasperation. Now she ad got to be bothered by that
      beast of a woman! Now she must start and fret! She had no letter from
      Mellors. They had agreed not to write at all, but now she wanted to hear
      from him personally. After all, he was the father of the child that was
      coming. Let him write!</p>
      <p>But how hateful! Now everything was messed up. How foul those low
      people were! How nice it was here, in the sunshine and the indolence,
      compared to that dismal mess of that English Midlands! After all, a clear
      sky was almost the most important thing in life.</p>
      <p>She did not mention the fact of her pregnancy, even to Hilda. She wrote
      to Mrs. Bolton for exact information.</p>
      <p>Duncan Forbes, an artist friend of theirs, had arrived at the Villa
      Esmeralda, coming north from Rome. Now he made a third in the gondola, and
      he bathed with them across the lagoon, and was their escort: a quiet,
      almost taciturn young man, very advanced in his art.</p>
      <p>She had a letter from Mrs. Bolton:</p>
      <p>&quot;You will be pleased, I am sure, my Lady, when you see Sir
      Clifford. He's looking quite blooming and working very hard, and very
      hopeful. Of course he is looking forward to seeing you among us again. It
      is a dull house without my Lady, and we shall all welcome her presence
      among us once more.</p>
      <p>About Mr. Mellors, I don't know how much Sir Clifford told you. It
      seems his wife came back all of a sudden one afternoon, and he found her
      sitting on the doorstep when he came in from the wood. She said she was
      come back to him and wanted to live with him again, as she was his legal
      wife, and he wasn't going to divorce her. But he wouldn't have anything to
      do with her, and wouldn't let her in the house, and did not go in himself;
      he went back into the wood without ever opening the door.</p>
      <p>But when he came back after dark, he found the house broken into, so he
      went upstairs to see what she'd done, and he found her in bed without a
      rag on her. He offered her money, but she said she was his wife and he
      must take her back. I don't know what sort of a scene they had. His mother
      told me about it, she's terribly upset. Well, he told her he'd die rather
      than ever live with her again, so he took his things and went straight to
      his mother's on Tevershall hill. He stopped the night and went to the wood
      next day through the park, never going near the cottage. It seems he never
      saw his wife that day. But the day after she was at her brother Pan's at
      Beggarlee, swearing and carrying on, saying she was his legal wife, and
      that he'd beers having women at the cottage, because she'd found a
      scent-bottle in his drawer, and gold-tipped cigarette-ends on the
      ash-heap, and I don't know what all. Then it seems the postman Fred Kirk
      says he heard somebody talking in Mr. Mellors' bedroom early one morning,
      and a motor-car had been in the lane.</p>
      <p>Mr. Mellors stayed on with his mother, and went to the wood through the
      park, and it seems she stayed on at the cottage. Well, there was no end of
      talk. So at last Mr Mellors and Tom Phillips went to the cottage and
      fetched away most of the furniture and bedding, and unscrewed the handle
      of the pump, so she was forced to go. But instead of going back to Stacks
      Gate she went and lodged with that Mrs. Swain at Beggarlee, because her
      brother Dan's wife wouldn't have her. And she kept going to old Mrs.
      Mellors' house, to catch him, and she began swearing he'd got in bed with
      her in the cottage and she went to a lawyer to make him pay her an
      allowance. She's grown heavy, and more common than ever, and as strong as
      a bull. And she goes about saying the most awful things about him, how he
      has women at the cottage, and how he behaved to her when they were
      married, the low, beastly things he did to her, and I don't know what all.
      I'm sure it's awful, the mischief a woman can do, once she starts talking.
      And no matter how low she may be, there'll be some as will believe her,
      and some of the dirt will stick. I'm sure the way she makes out that Mr.
      Mellors was one of those low, beastly men with women, is simply shocking.
      And people are only too ready to believe things against anybody,
      especially things like that. She declared she'll never leave him alone
      while he lives. Though what I say is, if he was so beastly to her, why is
      she so anxious to go back to him? But of course she's coming near her
      change of life, for she's years older than he is. And these common,
      violent women always go partly insane whets the change of life comes upon
      them.---&quot;</p>
      <p>This was a nasty blow to Connie. Here she was, sure as life, coming in
      for her share of the lowness and dirt. She felt angry with him for not
      having got clear of a Bertha Coutts: nay, for ever having married her.
      Perhaps he had a certain hankering after lowness. Connie remembered the
      last night she had spent with him, and shivered. He had known all that
      sensuality, even with a Bertha Coutts! It was really rather disgusting. It
      would be well to be rid of him, clear of him altogether. He was perhaps
      really common, really low.</p>
