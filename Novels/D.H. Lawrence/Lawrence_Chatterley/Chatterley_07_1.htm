 <p>When Connie went up to her bedroom she did what she had not done for a
      long time: took off all her clothes, and looked at herself naked in the
      huge mirror. She did not know what she was looking for, or at, very
      definitely, yet she moved the lamp till it shone full on her.</p>
      <p>And she thought, as she had thought so often, . . what a frail, easily
      hurt, rather pathetic thing a human body is, naked; somehow a little
      unfinished, incomplete!</p>
      <p>She had been supposed to have rather a good figure, but now she was out
      of fashion: a little too female, not enough like an adolescent boy. She
      was not very tall, a bit Scottish and short; but she had a certain fluent,
      down-slipping grace that might have been beauty. Her skin was faintly
      tawny, her limbs had a certain stillness, her body should have had a full,
      down-slipping richness; but it lacked something.</p>
      <p>Instead of ripening its firm, down-running curves, her body was
      flattening and going a little harsh. It was as if it had not had enough
      sun and warmth; it was a little greyish and sapless.</p>
      <p>Disappointed of its real womanhood, it had not succeeded in becoming
      boyish, and unsubstantial, and transparent; instead it had gone opaque.</p>
      <p>Her breasts were rather small, and dropping pear-shaped. But they were
      unripe, a little bitter, without meaning hanging there. And her belly had
      lost the fresh, round gleam it had had when she was young, in the days of
      her German boy, who really loved her physically. Then it was young and
      expectant, with a real look of its own. Now it was going slack, and a
      little flat, thinner, but with a slack thinness. Her thighs, too, they
      used to look so quick and glimpsey in their female roundness, somehow they
      too were going flat, slack, meaningless.</p>
      <p>Her body was going meaningless, going dull and opaque, so much
      insignificant substance. It made her feel immensely depressed and
      hopeless. What hope was there? She was old, old at twenty-seven, with no
      gleam and sparkle in the flesh. Old through neglect and denial, yes,
      denial. Fashionable women kept their bodies bright like delicate
      porcelain, by external attention. There was nothing inside the porcelain;
      but she was not even as bright as that. The mental life! Suddenly she
      hated it with a rushing fury, the swindle!</p>
      <p>She looked in the other mirror's reflection at her back, her waist, her
      loins. She was getting thinner, but to her it was not becoming. The
      crumple of her waist at the back, as she bent back to look, was a little
      weary; and it used to be so gay-looking. And the longish slope of her
      haunches and her buttocks had lost its gleam and its sense of richness.
      Gone! Only the German boy had loved it, and he was ten years dead, very
      nearly. How time went by! Ten years dead, and she was only twenty-seven.
      The healthy boy with his fresh, clumsy sensuality that she had then been
      so scornful of! Where would she find it now? It was gone out of men. They
      had their pathetic, two-seconds spasms like Michaelis; but no healthy
      human sensuality, that warms the blood and freshens the whole being.</p>
      <p>Still she thought the most beautiful part of her was the long-sloping
      fall of the haunches from the socket of the back, and the slumberous,
      round stillness of the buttocks. Like hillocks of sand, the Arabs say,
      soft and downward-slipping with a long slope. Here the life still lingered
      hoping. But here too she was thinner, and going unripe, astringent.</p>
      <p>But the front of her body made her miserable. It was already beginning
      to slacken, with a slack sort of thinness, almost withered, going old
      before it had ever really lived. She thought of the child she might
      somehow bear. Was she fit, anyhow?</p>
      <p>She slipped into her nightdress, and went to bed, where she sobbed
      bitterly. And in her bitterness burned a cold indignation against
      Clifford, and his writings and his talk: against all the men of his sort
      who defrauded a woman even of her own body.</p>
      <p>Unjust! Unjust! The sense of deep physical injustice burned to her very
      soul.</p>
      <p>But in the morning, all the same, she was up at seven, and going
      downstairs to Clifford. She had to help him in all the intimate things,
      for he had no man, and refused a woman-servant. The housekeeper's husband,
      who had known him as a boy, helped him, and did any heavy lifting; but
      Connie did the personal things, and she did them willingly. It was a
      demand on her, but she had wanted to do what she could.</p>
      <p>So she hardly ever went away from Wragby, and never for more than a day
      or two; when Mrs. Betts, the housekeeper, attended to Clifford. He, as was
      inevitable in the course of time, took all the service for granted. It was
      natural he should.</p>
      <p>And yet, deep inside herself, a sense of injustice, of being defrauded,
      had begun to burn in Connie. The physical sense of injustice is a
      dangerous feeling, once it is awakened. It must have outlet, or it eats
      away the one in whom it is aroused. Poor Clifford, he was not to blame.
      His was the greater misfortune. It was all part of the general
      catastrophe.</p>
      <p>And yet was he not in a way to blame? This lack of warmth, this lack of
      the simple, warm, physical contact, was he not to blame for that? He was
      never really warm, nor even kind, only thoughtful, considerate, in a
      well-bred, cold sort of way! But never warm as a man can be warm to a
      woman, as even Connie's father could be warm to her, with the warmth of a
      man who did himself well, and intended to, but who still could comfort it
      woman with a bit of his masculine glow.</p>
      <p>But Clifford was not like that. His whole race was not like that. They
      were all inwardly hard and separate, and warmth to them was just bad
      taste. You had to get on without it, and hold your own; which was all very
      well if you were of the same class and race. Then you could keep yourself
      cold and be very estimable, and hold your own, and enjoy the satisfaction
      of holding it. But if you were of another class and another race it
      wouldn't do; there was no fun merely holding your own, and feeling you
      belonged to the ruling class. What was the point, when even the smartest
      aristocrats had really nothing positive of their own to hold, and their
      rule was really a farce, not rule at all? What was the point? It was all
      cold nonsense.</p>
      <p>A sense of rebellion smouldered in Connie. What was the good of it all?
      What was the good of her sacrifice, her devoting her life to Clifford?
      What was she serving, after all? A cold spirit of vanity, that had no warm
      human contacts, and that was as corrupt as any low-born Jew, in craving
      for prostitution to the bitch-goddess, Success. Even Clifford's cool and
      contactless assurance that he belonged to the ruling class didn't prevent
      his tongue lolling out of his mouth, as he panted after the bitch-goddess.
      After all, Michaelis was really more dignified in the matter, and far, far
      more successful. Really, if you looked closely at Clifford, he was a
      buffoon, and a buffoon is more humiliating than a bounder.</p>
      <p>As between the two men, Michaelis really had far more use for her than
      Clifford had. He had even more need of her. Any good nurse can attend to
      crippled legs! And as for the heroic effort, Michaelis was a heroic rat,
      and Clifford was very much of a poodle showing off.</p>
