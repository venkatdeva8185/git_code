 <p>&quot;Dear Clifford, I am afraid what you foresaw has happened. I am
      really in love with another man, and do hope you will divorce me. I am
      staying at present with Duncan its his flat. I told you he was at Venice
      with us. I'm awfully unhappy for your sake: but do try to take it quietly.
      You don't really need me any more, and I can't bear to come back to Wragby.
      I'm awfully sorry. But do try to forgive me, and divorce me and find
      someone better. I'm not really the right person for you, I am too
      impatient and selfish, I suppose. But I can't ever come back to live with
      you again. And I feel so frightfully sorry about it all, for your sake.
      But if you don't let yourself get worked up, you'll see you won't mind so
      frightfully. You didn't really care about me personally. So do forgive me
      and get rid of me.&quot;</p>
      <p>Clifford was not <i>inwardly</i> surprised to get this letter.
      Inwardly, he had known for a long time she was leaving him. But he had
      absolutely refused any outward admission of it. Therefore, outwardly, it
      came as the most terrible blow and shock to him, He had kept the surface
      of his confidence in her quite serene.</p>
      <p>And that is how we are, By strength of will we cut of four inner
      intuitive knowledge from admitted consciousness. This causes a state of
      dread, or apprehension, which makes the blow ten times worse when it does
      fall.</p>
      <p>Clifford was like a hysterical child. He gave Mrs. Bolton a terrible
      shock, sitting up in bed ghastly and blank.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, Sir Clifford, whatever's the matter?&quot;</p>
      <p>No answer! She was terrified lest he had had a stroke. She hurried and
      felt his face, took his pulse.</p>
      <p>&quot;Is there a pain? Do try and tell me where it hurts you. Do tell
      me!&quot;</p>
      <p>No answer!</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh dear, oh dear! Then I'll telephone to Sheffield for Dr
      Carrington, and Dr. Lecky may as well run round straight away.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was moving to the door, when he said in a hollow tone:</p>
      <p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>
      <p>She stopped and gazed at him. His face was yellow, blank, and like the
      face of an idiot.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you mean you'd rather I didn't fetch the doctor?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! I don't want him,&quot; came the sepulchral voice.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, but Sir Clifford, you're ill, and I daren't take the
      responsibility. I <i>must</i> send for the doctor, or <i>I</i> shall be
      blamed.&quot;</p>
      <p>A pause: then the hollow voice said:</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm not ill. My wife isn't coming back.&quot;---It was as if an
      image spoke.</p>
      <p>&quot;Not coming back? you mean her ladyship?&quot; Mrs. Bolton moved a
      little nearer to the bed. &quot;Oh, don't you believe it. You can trust
      her ladyship to come back.&quot;</p>
      <p>The image in the bed did not change, but it pushed a letter over the
      counterpane.</p>
      <p>&quot;Read it!&quot; said the sepulchral voice.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, if it's a letter from her ladyship, I'm sure her ladyship
      wouldn't want me to read her letter to you, Sir Clifford. You can tell me
      what she says, if you wish.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Read it!&quot; repeated the voice.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, if I must, I do it to obey you, Sir Clifford,&quot; she
      said. And she read the letter.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, I <i>am</i> surprised at her ladyship,&quot; she said.
      &quot;She promised so faithfully she'd come back!&quot;</p>
      <p>The face in the bed seemed to deepen its expression of wild, but
      motionless distraction. Mrs. Bolton looked at it and was worried. She knew
      what she was up against: male hysteria. She had not nursed soldiers
      without learning something about that very unpleasant disease.</p>
      <p>She was a little impatient of Sir Clifford. Any man in his senses must
      have <i>known</i> his wife was in love with somebody else, and was going
      to leave him. Even, she was sure, Sir Clifford was inwardly absolutely
      aware of it, only he wouldn't admit it to himself. If he would have
      admitted it, and prepared himself for it: or if he would have admitted it,
      and actively struggled with his wife against it: that would have been
      acting like a man. But no! he knew it, and all the time tried to kid
      himself it wasn't so. He felt the devil twisting his tail, and pretended
      it was the angels smiling on him. This state of falsity had now brought on
      that crisis of falsity and dislocation, hysteria, which is a form of
      insanity. &quot;It comes&quot;, she thought to herself, hating him a
      little, &quot;because he always thinks of himself. He's so wrapped up in
      his own immortal self, that when he does get a shock he's like a mummy
      tangled in its own bandages. Look at him!&quot;</p>
      <p>But hysteria is dangerous: and she was a nurse, it was her duty to pull
      him out. Any attempt to rouse his manhood and his pride would only make
      him worse: for his manhood was dead, temporarily if not finally. He would
      only squirm softer and softer, like a worm, and become more dislocated.</p>
      <p>The only thing was to release his self-pity. Like the lady in Tennyson,
      he must weep or he must die.</p>
      <p>So Mrs. Bolton began to weep first. She covered her face with her hand
      and burst into little wild sobs. &quot;I would never have believed it of
      her ladyship, I wouldn't!&quot; she wept, suddenly summoning up all her
      old grief and sense of woe, and weeping the tears of her own bitter
      chagrin. Once she started, her weeping was genuine enough, for she had had
      something to weep for.</p>
      <p>Clifford thought of the way he had been betrayed by the woman Connie,
      and in a contagion of grief, tears filled his eyes and began to run down
      his cheeks. He was weeping for himself. Mrs. Bolton, as soon as she saw
      the tears running over his blank face, hastily wiped her own wet cheeks on
      her little handkerchief, and leaned towards him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Now, don't you fret, Sir Clifford!&quot; she said, in a luxury of
      emotion. &quot;Now, don't you fret, don't, you'll only do yourself an
      injury!&quot;</p>
      <p>His body shivered suddenly in an indrawn breath of silent sobbing, and
      the tears ran quicker down his face. She laid her hand on his arm, and her
      own tears fell again. Again the shiver went through him, like a
      convulsion, and she laid her arm round his shoulder. &quot;There, there!
      There, there! Don't you fret, then, don't you! Don't you fret!&quot; she
      moaned to him, while her own tears fell. And she drew him to her, and held
      her arms round his great shoulders, while he laid his face on her bosom
      and sobbed, shaking and hulking his huge shoulders, whilst she softly
      stroked his dusky-blond hair and said: &quot;There! There! There! There
      then! There then! Never you mind! Never you mind, then!&quot;</p>
      <p>And he put his arms round her and clung to her like a child, wetting
      the bib of her starched white apron, and the bosom of her pale-blue cotton
      dress, with his tears. He had let himself go altogether, at last.</p>
      <p>So at length she kissed him, and rocked him on her bosom, and in her
      heart she said to herself: `Oh, Sir Clifford! Oh, high and mighty
      Chatterleys! Is this what you've come down to!' And finally he even went
      to sleep, like a child. And she felt worn out, and went to her own room,
      where she laughed and cried at once, with a hysteria of her own. It was so
      ridiculous! It was so awful! Such a come-down! So shameful! And it <i>was</i>
      so upsetting as well.</p>
