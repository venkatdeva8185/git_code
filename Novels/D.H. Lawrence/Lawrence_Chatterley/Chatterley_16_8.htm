 <p>&quot;Morning, Mr. Mellors! Registered letter!'</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh ay! Got a pencil?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Here y'are!&quot;</p>
      <p>There was a pause.</p>
      <p>&quot;Canada!&quot; said the stranger's voice.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! That's a mate o' mine out there in British Columbia. Dunno
      what he's got to register.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;'Appen sent y'a fortune, like.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;More like wants summat.&quot;</p>
      <p>Pause.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well! Lovely day again!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Morning!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Morning!&quot;</p>
      <p>After a time he came upstairs again, looking a little angry.</p>
      <p>&quot;Postman,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Very early!&quot; she replied.</p>
      <p>&quot;Rural round; he's mostly here by seven, when he does come.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Did your mate send you a fortune?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! Only some photographs and papers about a place out there in
      British Columbia.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Would you go there?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I thought perhaps we might.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh yes! I believe it's lovely!&quot; But he was put out by the
      postman's coming.</p>
      <p>&quot;Them damn bikes, they're on you afore you know where you are. I
      hope he twigged nothing.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;After all, what could he twig!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You must get up now, and get ready. I'm just goin' ter look round
      outside.&quot;</p>
      <p>She saw him go reconnoitring into the lane, with dog and gun. She went
      downstairs and washed, and was ready by the time he came back, with the
      few things in the little silk bag.</p>
      <p>He locked up, and they set off, but through the wood, not down the
      lane. He was being wary.</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't you think one lives for times like last night?&quot; she
      said to him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! But there's the rest o'times to think on,&quot; he replied,
      rather short.</p>
      <p>They plodded on down the overgrown path, he in front, in silence.</p>
      <p>&quot;And we <i>will</i> live together and make a life together, won't
      we?&quot; she pleaded.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; he replied, striding on without looking round.
      &quot;When t' time comes! Just now you're off to Venice or
      somewhere.&quot;</p>
      <p>She followed him dumbly, with sinking heart. Oh, now she was <i>wae </i>to
      go!</p>
      <p>At last he stopped.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll just strike across here,&quot; he said, pointing to the
      right.</p>
      <p>But she flung her arms round his neck, and clung to him.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you'll keep the tenderness for me, won't you?&quot; she
      whispered. &quot;I loved last night. But you'll keep the tenderness for
      me, won't you?&quot;</p>
      <p>He kissed her and held her close for a moment. Then he sighed, and
      kissed her again.</p>
      <p>&quot;I must go an' look if th' car's there.&quot;</p>
      <p>He strode over the low brambles and bracken, leaving a trail through
      the fern. For a minute or two he was gone. Then he came striding back.</p>
      <p>&quot;Car's not there yet,&quot; he said. &quot;But there's the baker's
      cart on t' road.&quot;</p>
      <p>He seemed anxious and troubled.</p>
      <p>&quot;Hark!&quot;</p>
      <p>They heard a car softly hoot as it came nearer. It slowed up on the
      bridge.</p>
      <p>She plunged with utter mournfulness in his track through the fern, and
      came to a huge holly hedge. He was just behind her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Here! Go through there!&quot; he said, pointing to a gap. &quot;I
      shan't come out.&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked at him in despair. But he kissed her and made her go. She
      crept in sheer misery through the holly and through the wooden fence,
      stumbled down the little ditch and up into the lane, where Hilda was just
      getting out of the car in vexation.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why you're there!&quot; said Hilda. &quot;Where's <i>he</i>?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;He's not coming.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie's face was running with tears as she got into the car with her
      little bag. Hilda snatched up the motoring helmet with the disfiguring
      goggles.</p>
      <p>&quot;Put it on!&quot; she said. And Connie pulled on the disguise,
      then the long motoring coat, and she sat down, a goggling inhuman,
      unrecognizable creature. Hilda started the car with a businesslike motion.
      They heaved out of the lane, and were away down the road. Connie had
      looked round, but there was no sight of him. Away! Away! She sat in bitter
      tears. The parting had come so suddenly, so unexpectedly. It was like
      death.</p>
      <p>&quot;Thank goodness you'll be away from him for some time!&quot; said
      Hilda, turning to avoid Crosshill village.</p>
