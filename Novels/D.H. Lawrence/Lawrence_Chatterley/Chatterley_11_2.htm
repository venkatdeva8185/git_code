 <p>&quot;But where will you find the proper engines for burning your
      fuel?&quot; asked Winter.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll make them myself. And I'll use my fuel myself. And I'll sell
      electric power. I'm certain I could do it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;If you can do it, then splendid, splendid, my dear boy. Haw!
      Splendid! If I can be of any help, I shall be delighted. I'm afraid I am a
      little out of date, and my collieries are like me. But who knows, when I'm
      gone, there may be men like you. Splendid! It will employ all the men
      again, and you won't have to sell your coal, or fail to sell it. A
      splendid idea, and I hope it will be a success. If I had sons of my own,
      no doubt they would have up-to-date ideas for Shipley: no doubt! By the
      way, dear boy, is there any foundation to the rumour that we may entertain
      hopes of an heir to Wragby?'&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Is there a rumour?'&quot; asked Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, my dear boy, Marshall from Fillingwood asked me, that's all
      I can say about a rumour. Of course I wouldn't repeat it for the world, if
      there were no foundation.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, Sir,&quot; said Clifford uneasily, but with strange bright
      eyes. &quot;There is a hope. There is a hope.&quot;</p>
      <p>Winter came across the room and wrung Clifford's hand.</p>
      <p>&quot;My dear boy, my dear lad, can you believe what it means to me, to
      hear that! And to hear you are working in the hopes of a son: and that you
      may again employ every man at Tevershall. Ah, my boy! to keep up the level
      of the race, and to have work waiting for any man who cares to
      work!---&quot;</p>
      <p>The old man was really moved.</p>
      <p>Next day Connie was arranging tall yellow tulips in a glass vase.</p>
      <p>&quot;Connie,&quot; said Clifford, &quot;did you know there was a
      rumour that you are going to supply Wragby with a son and heir?&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie felt dim with terror, yet she stood quite still, touching the
      flowers.</p>
      <p>&quot;No!&quot; she said. &quot;Is it a joke? Or malice?&quot;</p>
      <p>He paused before he answered:</p>
      <p>&quot;Neither, I hope. I hope it may be a prophecy.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie went on with her flowers.</p>
      <p>&quot;I had a letter from Father this morning,&quot; She said. &quot;He
      wants to know if I am aware he has accepted Sir Alexander Cooper's
      Invitation for me for July and August, to the Villa Esmeralda in
      Venice.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;July <i>and</i> August?&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I wouldn't stay all that time. Are you sure you wouldn't
      come?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I won't travel abroad,&quot; said Clifford promptly. She took her
      flowers to the window.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you mind if I go?&quot; she said. You know it was promised,
      for this summer.</p>
      <p>&quot;For how long would you go?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps three weeks.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was silence for a time.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Clifford slowly, and a little gloomily. &quot;I
      suppose I could stand it for three weeks: if I were absolutely sure you'd
      want to come back.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I should want to come back,&quot; she said, with a quiet
      simplicity, heavy with conviction. She was thinking of the other man.</p>
      <p>Clifford felt her conviction, and somehow he believed her, he believed
      it was for him. He felt immensely relieved, joyful at once.</p>
      <p>&quot;In that case,&quot; he said, &quot;I think it would be all right,
      don't you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I think so,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;You'd enjoy the change?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>She looked up at him with strange blue eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;I should like to see Venice again,&quot; she said, &quot;and to
      bathe from one of the shingle islands across the lagoon. But you know I
      loathe the Lido! And I don't fancy I shall like Sir Alexander Cooper and
      Lady Cooper. But if Hilda is there, and we have a gondola of our own: yes,
      it will be rather lovely. I <i>do</i> wish you'd come.&quot;</p>
      <p>She said it sincerely. She would so love to make him happy, in these
      ways.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah, but think of me, though, at the Gare du Nord: at Calais
      quay!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But why not? I see other men carried in litter-chairs, who have
      been wounded in the war. Besides, we'd motor all the way.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;We should need to take two men.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh no! We'd manage with Field. There would always be another man
      there.&quot;</p>
      <p>But Clifford shook his head.</p>
      <p>&quot;Not this year, dear! Not this year! Next year probably I'll
      try.&quot;</p>
      <p>She went away gloomily. Next year! What would next year bring? She
      herself did not really want to go to Venice: not now, now there was the
      other man. But she was going as a sort of discipline: and also because, if
      she had a child, Clifford could think she had a lover in Venice.</p>
      <p>It was already May, and in June they were supposed to start. Always
      these arrangements! Always one's life arranged for one! Wheels that worked
      one and drove one, and over which one had no real control!</p>
      <p>It was May, but cold and wet again. A cold wet May, good for corn and
      hay! Much the corn and hay matter nowadays! Connie had to go into Uthwaite,
      which was their little town, where the Chatterleys were still <i>the </i>Chatterleys.
      She went alone, Field driving her.</p>
      <p>In spite of May and a new greenness, the country was dismal. It was
      rather chilly, and there was smoke on the rain, and a certain sense of
      exhaust vapour in the air. One just had to live from one's resistance. No
      wonder these people were ugly and tough.</p>
