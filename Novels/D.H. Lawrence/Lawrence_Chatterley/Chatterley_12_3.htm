 <p>&quot;You see I've come!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, I see it!&quot; he said, straightening his back, and looking
      at her with a faint amusement.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you let the hens out now?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, they've sat themselves to skin and bone,&quot; he said.
      &quot;An' now they're not all that anxious to come out an' feed. There's
      no self in a sitting hen; she's all in the eggs or the chicks.&quot;</p>
      <p>The poor mother-hens; such blind devotion! even to eggs not their own!
      Connie looked at them in compassion. A helpless silence fell between the
      man and the woman.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall us go i' th' 'ut?&quot; he asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you want me?&quot; she asked, in a sort of mistrust.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, if you want to come.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was silent.</p>
      <p>&quot;Come then!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>And she went with him to the hut. It was quite dark when he had shut
      the door, so he made a small light in the lantern, as before.</p>
      <p>&quot;Have you left your underthings off?&quot; he asked her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, well, then I'll take my things off too.&quot;</p>
      <p>He spread the blankets, putting one at the side for a coverlet. She
      took off her hat, and shook her hair. He sat down, taking off his shoes
      and gaiters, and undoing his cord breeches.</p>
      <p>&quot;Lie down then!&quot; he said, when he stood in his shirt. She
      obeyed in silence, and he lay beside her, and pulled the blanket over them
      both.</p>
      <p>&quot;There!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>And he lifted her dress right back, till he came even to her breasts.
      He kissed them softly, taking the nipples in his lips in tiny caresses.</p>
      <p>&quot;Eh, but tha'rt nice, tha'rt nice!&quot; he said, suddenly rubbing
      his face with a snuggling movement against her warm belly.</p>
      <p>And she put her arms round him under his shirt, but she was afraid,
      afraid of his thin, smooth, naked body, that seemed so powerful, afraid of
      the violent muscles. She shrank, afraid.</p>
      <p>And when he said, with a sort of little sigh: &quot;Eh, tha'rt
      nice!&quot; something in her quivered, and something in her spirit
      stiffened in resistance: stiffened from the terribly physical intimacy,
      and from the peculiar haste of his possession. And this time the sharp
      ecstasy of her own passion did not overcome her; she lay with her ends
      inert on his striving body, and do what she might, her spirit seemed to
      look on from the top of her head, and the butting of his haunches seemed
      ridiculous to her, and the sort of anxiety of his penis to come to its
      little evacuating crisis seemed farcical. Yes, this was love, this
      ridiculous bouncing of the buttocks, and the wilting of the poor,
      insignificant, moist little penis. This was the divine love! After all,
      the moderns were right when they felt contempt for the performance; for it
      was a performance. It was quite true, as some poets said, that the God who
      created man must have had a sinister sense of humour, creating him a
      reasonable being, yet forcing him to take this ridiculous posture, and
      driving him with blind craving for this ridiculous performance. Even a
      Maupassant found it a humiliating anti-climax. Men despised the
      intercourse act, and yet did it.</p>
      <p>Cold and derisive her queer female mind stood apart, and though she lay
      perfectly still, her impulse was to heave her loins, and throw the man
      out, escape his ugly grip, and the butting over-riding of his absurd
      haunches. His body was a foolish, impudent, imperfect thing, a little
      disgusting in its unfinished clumsiness. For surely a complete evolution
      would eliminate this performance, this &quot;function&quot;.</p>
      <p>And yet when he had finished, soon over, and lay very very still,
      receding into silence, and a strange motionless distance, far, farther
      than the horizon of her awareness, her heart began to weep. She could feel
      him ebbing away, ebbing away, leaving her there like a stone on a shore.
      He was withdrawing, his spirit was leaving her. He knew.</p>
      <p>And in real grief, tormented by her own double consciousness and
      reaction, she began to weep. He took no notice, or did not even know. The
      storm of weeping swelled and shook her, and shook him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; he said. &quot;It was no good that time. You wasn't
      there.&quot;---So he knew! Her sobs became violent.</p>
      <p>&quot;But what's amiss?&quot; he said. &quot;It's once in a while that
      way.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I. . .I can't love you,&quot; she sobbed, suddenly feeling her
      heart breaking.</p>
      <p>&quot;Canna ter? Well, dunna fret! There's no law says as tha's got to.
      Ta'e it for what it is.&quot;</p>
      <p>He still lay with his hand on her breast. But she had drawn both her
      hands from him.</p>
      <p>His words were small comfort. She sobbed aloud.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay, nay!&quot; he said. &quot;Ta'e the thick wi' th' thin. This
      wor a bit o' thin for once.&quot;</p>
      <p>She wept bitterly, sobbing. &quot;But I want to love you, and I can't.
      It only seems horrid.&quot;</p>
      <p>He laughed a little, half bitter, half amused.</p>
      <p>&quot;It isna horrid,&quot; he said, &quot;even if tha thinks it is.
      An' tha canna ma'e it horrid. Dunna fret thysen about lovin' me. Tha'lt
      niver force thysen to `t. There's sure to be a bad nut in a basketful. Tha
      mun ta'e th' rough wi' th' smooth.&quot;</p>
      <p>He took his hand away from her breast, not touching her. And now she
      was untouched she took an almost perverse satisfaction in it. She hated
      the dialect: the <i>thee</i> and the <i>tha</i> and the <i>thysen</i>. He
      could get up if he liked, and stand there, above her, buttoning down those
      absurd corduroy breeches, straight in front of her. After all, Michaelis
      had had the decency to turn away. This man was so assured in himself he
      didn't know what a clown other people found him, a half-bred fellow.</p>
      <p>Yet, as he was drawing away, to rise silently and leave her, she clung
      to him in terror.</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't! Don't go! Don't leave me! Don't be cross with me! Hold me!
      Hold me fast!&quot; she whispered in blind frenzy, not even knowing what
      she said, and clinging to him with uncanny force. It was from herself she
      wanted to be saved, from her own inward anger and resistance. Yet how
      powerful was that inward resistance that possessed her!</p>
