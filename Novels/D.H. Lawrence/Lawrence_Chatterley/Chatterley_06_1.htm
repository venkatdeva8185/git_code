 <p>&quot;Why don't men and women really like one another nowadays?&quot;
      Connie asked Tommy Dukes, who was more or less her oracle.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, but they do! I don't think since the human species was
      invented, there has ever been a time when men and women have liked one
      another as much as they do today. Genuine liking! Take myself. . . I
      really <i>like</i> women better than men; they are braver, one can be more
      frank with them.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie pondered this.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah, yes, but you never have anything to do with them!&quot; she
      said.</p>
      <p>&quot;I? What am I doing but talking perfectly sincerely to a woman at
      this moment?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, talking. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And what more could I do if you were a man, than talk perfectly
      sincerely to you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Nothing perhaps. But a woman. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;A woman wants you to like her and talk to her, and at the same
      time love her and desire her; and it seems to me the two things are
      mutually exclusive.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But they shouldn't be!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No doubt water ought not to be so wet as it is; it overdoes it in
      wetness. But there it is! I like women and talk to them, and therefore I
      don't love them and desire them. The two things don't happen at the same
      time in me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I think they ought to.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;All right. The fact that things ought to be something else than
      what they are, is not my department.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie considered this. &quot;It isn't true,&quot; she said. &quot;Men
      can love women and talk to them. I don't see how they can love them <i>without</i>
      talking, and being friendly and intimate. How can they?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't know. What's the use of my
      generalizing? I only know my own case. I like women, but I don't desire
      them. I like talking to them; but talking to them, though it makes me
      intimate in one direction, sets me poles apart from them as far as kissing
      is concerned. So there you are! But don't take me as a general example,
      probably I'm just a special case: one of the men who like women, but don't
      love women, and even hate them if they force me into a pretence of love,
      or an entangled appearance.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But doesn't it make you sad?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why should it? Not a bit! I look at Charlie May, and the rest of
      the men who have affairs. . .No, I don't envy them a bit! If fate sent me
      a woman I wanted, well and good. Since I don't know any woman I want, and
      never see one. . .why, I presume I'm cold, and really <i>like</i> some
      women very much.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you like me?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Very much! And you see there's no question of kissing between us,
      is there?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;None at all!&quot; said Connie. &quot;But oughtn't there to
      be?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;<i>Why</i>, in God's name? I like Clifford, but what would you
      say if I went and kissed him?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But isn't there a difference?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Where does it lie, as far as we're concerned? We're all
      intelligent human beings, and the male and female business is in abeyance.
      Just in abeyance. How would you like me to start acting up like a
      continental male at this moment, and parading the sex thing?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I should hate it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well then! I tell you, if I'm really a male thing at all, I never
      run across the female of my species. And I don't miss her, I just like
      women. Who's going to force me into loving or pretending to love them,
      working up the sex game?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, I'm not. But isn't something wrong?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You may feel it, I don't.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, I feel something is wrong between men and women. A woman has
      no glamour for a man any more.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Has a man for a woman?&quot;</p>
      <p>She pondered the other side of the question.</p>
      <p>&quot;Not much,&quot; she said truthfully.</p>
      <p>&quot;Then let's leave it all alone, and just be decent and simple,
      like proper human beings with one another. Be damned to the artificial
      sex-compulsion! I refuse it!&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie knew he was right, really. Yet it left her feeling so forlorn,
      so forlorn and stray. Like a chip on a dreary pond, she felt. What was the
      point, of her or anything?</p>
      <p>It was her youth which rebelled. These men seemed so old and cold.
      Everything seemed old and cold. And Michaelis let one down so; he was no
      good. The men didn't want one; they just didn't really want a woman, even
      Michaelis didn't.</p>
      <p>And the bounders who pretended they did, and started working the sex
      game, they were worse than ever.</p>
      <p>It was just dismal, and one had to put up with it. It was quite true,
      men had no real glamour for a woman: if you could fool yourself into
      thinking they had, even as she had fooled herself over Michaelis, that was
      the best you could do. Meanwhile you just lived on and there was nothing
      to it. She understood perfectly well why people had cocktail parties, and
      jazzed, and Charlestoned till they were ready to drop. You had to take it
      out some way or other, your youth, or it ate you up. But what a ghastly
      thing, this youth! You felt as old as Methuselah, and yet the thing fizzed
      somehow, and didn't let you be comfortable. A mean sort of life! And no
      prospect! She almost wished she had gone off with Mick, and made her life
      one long cocktail party, and jazz evening. Anyhow that was better than
      just mooning yourself into the grave.</p>
      <p>On one of her bad days she went out alone to walk in the wood,
      ponderously, heeding nothing, not even noticing where she was. The report
      of a gun not far off startled and angered her.</p>
      <p>Then, as she went, she heard voices, and recoiled. People! She didn't
      want people. But her quick ear caught another sound, and she roused; it
      was a child sobbing. At once she attended -- someone was ill-treating a
      child. She strode swinging down the wet drive, her sullen resentment
      uppermost. She felt just prepared to make a scene.</p>
      <p>Turning the corner, she saw two figures in the drive beyond her: the
      keeper, and a little girl in a purple coat and moleskin cap, crying.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah, shut it up, tha false little bitch!&quot; came the man's
      angry voice, and the child sobbed louder.</p>
      <p>Constance strode nearer, with blazing eyes. The man turned and looked
      at her, saluting coolly, but he was pale with anger.</p>
