 <p>&quot; <i>I</i> shall never divorce you,&quot; he said, as if a nail
      had been driven in.</p>
      <p>&quot;But why? Because I want you to?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Because I follow my own inclination, and I'm not inclined
      to.&quot;</p>
      <p>It was useless. She went upstairs and told Hilda the upshot.</p>
      <p>&quot;Better get away tomorrow,&quot; said Hilda, &quot;and let him
      come to his senses.&quot;</p>
      <p>So Connie spent half the night packing her really private and personal
      effects. In the morning she had her trunks sent to the station, without
      telling Clifford. She decided to see him only to say good-bye, before
      lunch.</p>
      <p>But she spoke to Mrs. Bolton.</p>
      <p>&quot;I must say good-bye to you, Mrs. Bolton, you know why. But I can
      trust you not to talk.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, you can trust me, your Ladyship, though it's a sad blow for
      us here, indeed. But I hope you'll be happy with the other
      gentleman.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The other gentleman! It's Mr. Mellors, and I care for him. Sir
      Clifford knobs. But don't say anything to anybody. And if one day you
      think Sir Clifford may be willing to divorce me, let me know, will you? I
      should like to be properly married to the man I care for.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm sure you would, my Lady. Oh, you can trust me. I'll be
      faithful to Sir Clifford, and I'll be faithful to you, for I can see
      you're both right in your own ways.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Thank you! And look! I want to give you this---may I?&quot; So
      Connie left Wragby once more, and went on with Hilda to Scotland. Mellors
      went into the country and got work on a farm. The idea was, he should get
      his divorce, if possible, whether Connie got hers or not. And for six
      months he should work at farming, so that eventually he and Connie could
      have some small farm of their own, into which he could put his energy. For
      he would have to have some work, even hard work, to do, and he would have
      to make his own living, even if her capital started him.</p>
      <p>So they would have to wait till spring was in, till the baby was born,
      till the early summer came round again.</p>
      <p>&quot;The Grange Farm<br>
      &nbsp;Old Heanor,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      29 September,</p>
      <p>&quot;I got on here with a bit of contriving, because I knew Richards, the
      company engineer, in the army. It is a farm belonging to Butler and
      Smitham Colliery Company, they use it for raising hay and oats for the
      pit-ponies; not a private concern. But they've got cows and pigs and all
      the rest of it, and I get thirty shillings a week as labourer. Rowley, the
      farmer, puts me on to as many jobs as he can, so that I can learn as much
      as possible between now and next Easter. I've not heard a thing about
      Bertha. I've no idea why she didn't show up at the divorce, nor where she
      is nor what she's up to. But if I keep quiet till March I suppose I shall
      be free. And don't you bother about Sir Clifford. He'll want to get rid of
      you one of these days. If he leaves you alone, it's a lot.</p>
      <p>&quot;I've got lodging in a bit of an old cottage in Engine Row very decent.
      The man is engine-driver at High Park, tall, with a beard, and very
      chapel. The woman is a birdy bit of a thing who loves anything superior.
      King's English and allow-me! all the time. But they lost their only son in
      the war, and it's sort of knocked a hole in them. There's a long gawky
      lass of a daughter training for a school-teacher, and I help her with her
      lessons sometimes, so we're quite the family. But they're very decent
      people, and only too kind to me. I expect I'm more coddled than you are.</p>
      <p>&quot;I like farming all right. It's not inspiring, but then I don't ask to
      be inspired. I'm used to horses, and cows, though they are very female,
      have a soothing effect on me. When I sit with my head in her side,
      milking, I feel very solaced. They have six rather fine Herefords.
      Oat-harvest is just over and I enjoyed it, in spite of sore hands and a
      lot of rain. I don't take much notice of people, but get on with them all
      right. Most things one just ignores.</p>
      <p>&quot;The pits are working badly; this is a colliery district like Tevershall.
      only prettier. I sometimes sit in the Wellington and talk to the men. They
      grumble a lot, but they're not going to alter anything. As everybody says,
      the Notts-Derby miners have got their hearts in the right place. But the
      rest of their anatomy must be in the wrong place, in a world that has no
      use for them. I like them, but they don't cheer me much: not enough of the
      old fighting-cock in them. They talk a lot about nationalization,
      nationalization of royalties, nationalization of the whole industry. But
      you can't nationalize coal and leave all the other industries as they are.
      They talk about putting coal to new uses, like Sir Clifford is trying to
      do. It may work here and there, but not as a general thing. I doubt.
      Whatever you make you've got to sell it. The men are very apathetic. They
      feel the whole damned thing is doomed, and I believe it is. And they are
      doomed along with it. Some of the young ones spout about a Soviet, but
      there's not much conviction in them. There's no sort of conviction about
      anything, except that it's all a muddle and a hole. Even under a Soviet
      you've still got to sell coal: and that's the difficulty.</p>
      <p>&quot;We've got this great industrial population, and they've got to be fed,
      so the damn show has to be kept going somehow. The women talk a lot more
      than the men, nowadays, and they are a sight more cock-sure. The men are
      limp, they feel a doom somewhere, and they go about as if there was
      nothing to be done. Anyhow, nobody knows what should be done in spite of
      all the talk, the young ones get mad because they've no money to spend.
      Their whole life depends on spending money, and now they've got none to
      spend. That's our civilization and our education: bring up the masses to
      depend entirely on spending money, and then the money gives out. The pits
      are working two days, two and a half days a week, and there's no sign of
      betterment even for the winter. It means a man bringing up a family on
      twenty-five and thirty shillings. The women are the maddest of all. But
      then they're the maddest for spending, nowadays.</p>
