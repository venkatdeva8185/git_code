 <p>&quot;People are always horrid,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;And did you mind very much?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I minded, as I always shall mind. And I knew I was a fool to
      mind.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Did you feel like a dog with a tin can tied to its tail? Clifford
      said you felt like that.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her. It was cruel of her at that moment: for his pride had
      suffered bitterly.</p>
      <p>&quot;I suppose I did,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>She never knew the fierce bitterness with which he resented insult.</p>
      <p>There was a long pause.</p>
      <p>&quot;And did you miss me?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;I was glad you were out of it.&quot;</p>
      <p>Again there was a pause.</p>
      <p>&quot;But did people <i>believe</i> about you and me?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! I don't think so for a moment.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Did Clifford?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I should say not. He put it off without thinking about it. But
      naturally it made him want to see the last of me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm going to have a child.&quot;</p>
      <p>The expression died utterly out of his face, out of his whole body. He
      looked at her with darkened eyes, whose look she could not understand at
      all: like some dark-flamed spirit looking at her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Say you're glad!&quot; she pleaded, groping for his hand. And she
      saw a certain exultance spring up in him. But it was netted down by things
      she could not understand.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's the future,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;But aren't you glad?&quot; she persisted.</p>
      <p>&quot;I have such a terrible mistrust of the future.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you needn't be troubled by any responsibility. Clifford would
      have it as his own, he'd be glad.&quot;</p>
      <p>She saw him go pale, and recoil under this. He did not answer.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall I go back to Clifford and put a little baronet into Wragby?&quot;
      she asked.</p>
      <p>He looked at her, pale and very remote. The ugly little grin flickered
      on his face.</p>
      <p>&quot;You wouldn't have to tell him who the father was?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh!' she said; &quot;he'd take it even then, if I wanted him
      to.&quot;</p>
      <p>He thought for a time.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; he said at last, to himself. &quot;I suppose he
      would.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was silence. A big gulf was between them.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you don't want me to go back to Clifford, do you?&quot; she
      asked him.</p>
      <p>&quot;What do you want yourself?&quot; he replied.</p>
      <p>&quot;I want to live with you,&quot; she said simply.</p>
      <p>In spite of himself, little flames ran over his belly as he heard her
      say it, and he dropped his head. Then he looked up at her again, with
      those haunted eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;If it's worth it to you,&quot; he said. &quot;I've got
      nothing.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You've got more than most men. Come, you know it,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;In one way, I know it.&quot; He was silent for a time, thinking.
      Then he resumed: &quot;They used to say I had too much of the woman in me.
      But it's not that. I'm not a woman not because I don't want to shoot
      birds, neither because I don't want to make money, or get on. I could have
      got on in the army, easily, but I didn't like the army. Though I could
      manage the men all right: they liked me and they had a bit of a holy fear
      of me when I got mad. No, it was stupid, dead-handed higher authority that
      made the army dead: absolutely fool-dead. I like men, and men like me. But
      I can't stand the twaddling bossy impudence of the people who run this
      world. That's why I can't get on. I hate the impudence of money, and I
      hate the impudence of class. So in the world as it is, what have I to
      offer a woman?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But why offer anything? It's not a bargain. It's just that we
      love one another,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay, nay! It's more than that. Living is moving and moving on. My
      life won't go down the proper gutters, it just won't. So I'm a bit of a
      waste ticket by myself. And I've no business to take a woman into my life,
      unless my life does something and gets somewhere, inwardly at least, to
      keep us both fresh. A man must offer a woman some meaning in his life, if
      it's going to be an isolated life, and if she's a genuine woman. I can't
      be just your male concubine.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, because I can't. And you would soon hate it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;As if you couldn't trust me,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>The grin flickered on his face.</p>
      <p>&quot;The money is yours, the position is yours, the decisions will lie
      with you. I'm not just my Lady's fucker, after all.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What else are you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You may well ask. It no doubt is invisible. Yet I'm something to
      myself at least. I can see the point of my own existence, though I can
      quite understand nobody else's seeing it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And will your existence have less point, if you live with
      me?&quot;</p>
      <p>He paused a long time before replying:</p>
      <p>&quot;It might.&quot;</p>
      <p>She too stayed to think about it.</p>
      <p>&quot;And what is the point of your existence?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I tell you, it's invisible. I don't believe in the world, not in
      money, nor in advancement, nor in the future of our civilization. If
      there's got to be a future for humanity, there'll have to be a very big
      change from what now is.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And what will the real future have to be like?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;God knows! I can feel something inside me, all mixed up with a
      lot of rage. But what it really amounts to, I don't know.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall I tell you?&quot; she said, looking into his face.
      &quot;Shall I tell you what you have that other men don't have, and that
      will make the future? Shall I tell you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Tell me then,&quot; he replied.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's the courage of your own tenderness, that's what it is: like
      when you put your hand on my tail and say I've got a pretty tail.&quot;</p>
      <p>The grin came flickering on his face.</p>
      <p>&quot;That!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>Then he sat thinking.</p>
