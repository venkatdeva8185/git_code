 <p>&quot;You see, Hilda,&quot; said Connie after lunch, when they were
      nearing London, &quot;you have never known either real tenderness or real
      sensuality: and if you do know them, with the same person, it makes a
      great difference.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;For mercy's sake don't brag about your experiences!&quot; said
      Hilda. &quot;I've never met the man yet who was capable of intimacy with a
      woman, giving himself up to her. That was what I wanted. I'm not keen on
      their self-satisfied tenderness, and their sensuality. I'm not content to
      be any man's little petsy-wetsy, nor his <i>chair à plaisir</i> either. I
      wanted a complete intimacy, and I didn't get it. That's enough for me.</p>
      <p>Connie pondered this. Complete intimacy! She supposed that meant
      revealing everything concerning yourself to the other person, and his
      revealing everything concerning himself. But that was a bore. And all that
      weary self-consciousness between a man and a woman! a disease!</p>
      <p>&quot;I think you're too conscious of yourself all the time, with
      everybody,&quot; she said to her sister.</p>
      <p>&quot;I hope at least I haven't a slave nature,&quot; said Hilda.</p>
      <p>&quot;But perhaps you have! Perhaps you are a slave to your own idea of
      yourself.&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda drove in silence for some time after this piece of unheard of
      insolence from that chit Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;At least I'm not a slave to somebody else's idea of me: and the
      somebody else a servant of my husband's,&quot; she retorted at last, in
      crude anger.</p>
      <p>&quot;You see, it's not so,&quot; said Connie calmly.</p>
      <p>She had always let herself be dominated by her elder sister. Now,
      though somewhere inside herself she was weeping, she was free of the
      dominion of <i>other women</i>. Ah! that in itself was a relief, like
      being given another life: to be free of the strange dominion and obsession
      of <i>other women</i>. How awful they were, women!</p>
      <p>She was glad to be with her father, whose favourite she had always
      been. She and Hilda stayed in a little hotel off Pall Mall, and Sir
      Malcolm was in his club. But he took his daughters out in the evening, and
      they liked going with him.</p>
      <p>He was still handsome and robust, though just a little afraid of the
      new world that had sprung up around him. He had got a second wife in
      Scotland, younger than himself and richer. But he had as many holidays
      away from her as possible: just as with his first wife.</p>
      <p>Connie sat next to him at the opera. He was moderately stout, and had
      stout thighs, but they were still strong and well-knit, the thighs of a
      healthy man who had taken his pleasure in life. His good-humoured
      selfishness, his dogged sort of independence, his unrepenting sensuality,
      it seemed to Connie she could see them all in his well-knit straight
      thighs. Just a man! And now becoming an old man, which is sad. Because in
      his strong, thick male legs there was none of the alert sensitiveness and
      power of tenderness which is the very essence of youth, that which never
      dies, once it is there.</p>
      <p>Connie woke up to the existence of legs. They became more important to
      her than faces, which are no longer very real. How few people had live,
      alert legs! She looked at the men in the stalls. Great puddingy thighs in
      black pudding-cloth, or lean wooden sticks in black funeral stuff, or
      well-shaped young legs without any meaning whatever, either sensuality or
      tenderness or sensitiveness, just mere leggy ordinariness that pranced
      around. Not even any sensuality like her father's. They were all daunted,
      daunted out of existence.</p>
      <p>But the women were not daunted. The awful mill-posts of most females!
      really shocking, really enough to justify murder! Or the poor thin pegs!
      or the trim neat things in silk stockings, without the slightest look of
      life! Awful, the millions of meaningless legs prancing meaninglessly
      around!</p>
      <p>But she was not happy in London. The people seemed so spectral and
      blank. They had no alive happiness, no matter how brisk and good-looking
      they were. It was all barren. And Connie had a woman's blind craving for
      happiness, to be assured of happiness.</p>
      <p>In Paris at any rate she felt a bit of sensuality still. But what a
      weary, tired, worn-out sensuality. Worn-out for lack of tenderness. Oh!
      Paris was sad. One of the saddest towns: weary of its now-mechanical
      sensuality, weary of the tension of money, money, money, weary even of
      resentment and conceit, just weary to death, and still not sufficiently
      Americanized or Londonized to hide the weariness under a mechanical
      jig-jig-jig! Ah, these manly he-men, these <i>flâneurs</i>, the oglers,
      these eaters of good dinners! How weary they were! weary, worn-out for
      lack of a little tenderness, given and taken. The efficient, sometimes
      charming women knew a thing or two about the sensual realities: they had
      that pull over their jigging English sisters. But they knew even less of
      tenderness. Dry, with the endless dry tension of will, they too were
      wearing out. The human world was just getting worn out. Perhaps it would
      turn fiercely destructive. A sort of anarchy! Clifford and his
      conservative anarchy! Perhaps it wouldn't be conservative much longer.
      Perhaps it would develop into a very radical anarchy.</p>
      <p>Connie found herself shrinking and afraid of the world. Sometimes she
      was happy for a little while in the Boulevards or in the Bois or the
      Luxembourg Gardens. But already Paris was full of Americans and English,
      strange Americans in the oddest uniforms, and the usual dreary English
      that are so hopeless abroad.</p>
      <p>She was glad to drive on. It was suddenly hot weather, so Hilda was
      going through Switzerland and over the Brenner, then through the Dolomites
      down to Venice. Hilda loved all the managing and the driving and being
      mistress of the show. Connie was quite content to keep quiet.</p>
      <p>And the trip was really quite nice. Only Connie kept saying to herself:
      Why don't I really care! Why am I never really thrilled? How awful, that I
      don't really care about the landscape any more! But I don't. It's rather
      awful. I'm like Saint Bernard, who could sail down the lake of Lucerne
      without ever noticing that there were even mountain and green water. I
      just don't care for landscape any more. Why should one stare at it? Why
      should one? I refuse to.</p>
      <p>No, she found nothing vital in France or Switzerland or the Tyrol or
      Italy. She just was carted through it all. And it was all less real than
      Wragby. Less real than the awful Wragby! She felt she didn't care if she
      never saw France or Switzerland or Italy again. They'd keep. Wragby was
      more real.</p>
      <p>As for people! people were all alike, with very little difference. They
      all wanted to get money out of you: or, if they were travellers, they
      wanted to get enjoyment, perforce, like squeezing blood out of a stone.
      Poor mountains! poor landscape! it all had to be squeezed and squeezed and
      squeezed again, to provide a thrill, to provide enjoyment. What did people
      mean, with their simply determined enjoying of themselves?</p>
