 <p>But Clifford was really extremely shy and self-conscious now he was
      lamed. He hated seeing anyone except just the personal servants. For he
      had to sit in a wheeled chair or a sort of bath-chair. Nevertheless he was
      just as carefully dressed as ever, by his expensive tailors, and he wore
      the careful Bond Street neckties just as before, and from the top he
      looked just as smart and impressive as ever. He had never been one of the
      modern ladylike young men: rather bucolic even, with his ruddy face and
      broad shoulders. But his very quiet, hesitating voice, and his eyes, at
      the same time bold and frightened, assured and uncertain, revealed his
      nature. His manner was often offensively supercilious, and then again
      modest and self-effacing, almost tremulous.</p>
      <p>Connie and he were attached to one another, in the aloof modern way. He
      was much too hurt in himself, the great shock of his maiming, to be easy
      and flippant. He was a hurt thing. And as such Connie stuck to him
      passionately.</p>
      <p>But she could not help feeling how little connection he really had with
      people. The miners were, in a sense, his own men; but he saw them as
      objects rather than men, parts of the pit rather than parts of life, crude
      raw phenomena rather than human beings along with him. He was in some way
      afraid of them, he could not bear to have them look at him now he was
      lame. And their queer, crude life seemed as unnatural as that of
      hedgehogs.</p>
      <p>He was remotely interested; but like a man looking down a microscope,
      or up a telescope. He was not in touch. He was not in actual touch with
      anybody, save, traditionally, with Wragby, and, through the close bond of
      family defence, with Emma. Beyond this nothing really touched him. Connie
      felt that she herself didn't really, not really touch him; perhaps there
      was nothing to get at ultimately; just a negation of human contact.</p>
      <p>Yet he was absolutely dependent on her, he needed her every moment. Big
      and strong as he was, he was helpless. He could wheel himself about in a
      wheeled chair, and he had a sort of bath-chair with a motor attachment, in
      which he could puff slowly round the park. But alone he was like a lost
      thing. He needed Connie to be there, to assure him he existed at all.</p>
      <p>Still he was ambitious. He had taken to writing stories; curious, very
      personal stories about people he had known. Clever, rather spiteful, and
      yet, in some mysterious way, meaningless. The observation was
      extraordinary and peculiar. But there was no touch, no actual contact. It
      was as if the whole thing took place in a vacuum. And since the field of
      life is largely an artificially-lighted stage today, the stories were
      curiously true to modern life, to the modern psychology, that is.</p>
      <p>Clifford was almost morbidly sensitive about these stories. He wanted
      everyone to think them good, of the best, <i>ne plus ultra</i>. They
      appeared in the most modern magazines, and were praised and blamed as
      usual. But to Clifford the blame was torture, like knives goading him. It
      was as if the whole of his being were in his stories.</p>
      <p>Connie helped him as much as she could. At first she was thrilled. He
      talked everything over with her monotonously, insistently, persistently,
      and she had to respond with all her might. It was as if her whole soul and
      body and sex had to rouse up and pass into theme stories of his. This
      thrilled her and absorbed her.</p>
      <p>Of physical life they lived very little. She had to superintend the
      house. But the housekeeper had served Sir Geoffrey for many years, arid
      the dried-up, elderly, superlatively correct female you could hardly call
      her a parlour-maid, or even a woman...who waited at table, had been in the
      house for forty years. Even the very housemaids were no longer young. It
      was awful! What could you do with such a place, but leave it alone! All
      these endless rooms that nobody used, all the Midlands routine, the
      mechanical cleanliness and the mechanical order! Clifford had insisted on
      a new cook, an experienced woman who had served him in his rooms in
      London. For the rest the place seemed run by mechanical anarchy.
      Everything went on in pretty good order, strict cleanliness, and strict
      punctuality; even pretty strict honesty. And yet, to Connie, it was a
      methodical anarchy. No warmth of feeling united it organically. The house
      seemed as dreary as a disused street.</p>
      <p>What could she do but leave it alone. . .? So she left it alone. Miss
      Chatterley came sometimes, with her aristocratic thin face, and triumphed,
      finding nothing altered. She would never forgive Connie for ousting her
      from her union in consciousness with her brother. It was she, Emma, who
      should be bringing forth the stories, these books, with him; the
      Chatterley stories, something new in the world, that <i>they</i>, the
      Chatterleys, had put there. There was no other standard. There was no
      organic connection with the thought and expression that had gone before.
      Only something new in the world: the Chatterley books, entirely personal.</p>
      <p>Connie's father, where he paid a flying visit to Wragby, and in private
      to his daughter: As for Clifford's writing, it's smart, but there's
      nothing in it. It won't last. . .Connie looked at the burly Scottish
      knight who had done himself well all his life, and her eyes, her big,
      still-wondering blue eyes became vague. Nothing in it! What did he mean by
      <i>nothing in it</i>? If the critics praised it, and Clifford's name was
      almost famous, and it even brought in money. . .what did her father mean
      by saying there was nothing in Clifford's writing? What else could there
      be?</p>
      <p>For Connie had adopted the standard of the young: what there was in the
      moment was everything. And moments followed one another without
      necessarily belonging to one another.</p>
      <p>It was in her second winter at Wragby her father said to her: &quot;I
      hope, Connie, you won't let circumstances force you into being a
      demi-vierge.'&quot;</p>
