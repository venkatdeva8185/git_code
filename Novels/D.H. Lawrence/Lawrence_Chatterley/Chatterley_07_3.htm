 <p>Then, when all the people went, it was no better. She continued
      plodding on, but exasperation and irritation had got hold of her lower
      body, she couldn't escape. The days seemed to grind by, with curious
      painfulness, yet nothing happened. Only she was getting thinner; even the
      housekeeper noticed it, and asked her about herself Even Tommy Dukes
      insisted she was not well, though she said she was all right. Only she
      began to be afraid of the ghastly white tombstones, that peculiar
      loathsome whiteness of Carrara marble, detestable as false teeth, which
      stuck up on the hillside, under Tevershall church, and which she saw with
      such grim painfulness from the park. The bristling of the hideous false
      teeth of tombstones on the hill affected her with a grisly kind of horror.
      She felt the time not far off when she would be buried there, added to the
      ghastly host under the tombstones and the monuments, in these filthy
      Midlands.</p>
      <p>She needed help, and she knew it: so she wrote a little &quot;<i>cri du
      coeur</i>&quot; to her sister, Hilda. &quot;I'm not well lately, and I
      don't know what's the matter with me.&quot;</p>
      <p>Down posted Hilda from Scotland, where she had taken up her abode. She
      came in March, alone, driving herself in a nimble two-seater. Up the drive
      she came, tooting up the incline, then sweeping round the oval of grass,
      where the two great wild beech-trees stood, on the flat in front of the
      house.</p>
      <p>Connie had run out to the steps. Hilda pulled up her car, got out, and
      kissed her sister.</p>
      <p>&quot;But Connie!&quot; she cried. &quot;Whatever is the matter?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Nothing!&quot; said Connie, rather shamefacedly; but she knew how
      she had suffered in contrast to Hilda. Both sisters had the same rather
      golden, glowing skin, and soft brown hair, and naturally strong, warm
      physique. But now Connie was thin and earthy-looking, with a scraggy,
      yellowish neck, that stuck out of her jumper.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you're ill, child!&quot; said Hilda, in the soft, rather
      breathless voice that both sisters had alike. Hilda was nearly, but not
      quite, two years older than Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;No, not ill. Perhaps I'm bored,&quot; said Connie a little
      pathetically.</p>
      <p>The light of battle glowed in Hilda's face; she was a woman, soft and
      still as she seemed, of the old amazon sort, not made to fit with men.</p>
      <p>&quot;This wretched place!&quot; she said softly, looking at poor, old,
      lumbering Wragby with real hate. She looked soft and warm herself, as a
      ripe pear, and she was an amazon of the real old breed.</p>
      <p>She went quietly in to Clifford. He thought how handsome she looked,
      but also he shrank from her. His wife's family did not have his sort of
      manners, or his sort of etiquette. He considered them rather outsiders,
      but once they got inside they made him jump through the hoop.</p>
      <p>He sat square and well-groomed in his chair, his hair sleek and blond,
      and his face fresh, his blue eyes pale, and a little prominent, his
      expression inscrutable, but well-bred. Hilda thought it sulky and stupid,
      and he waited. He had an air of aplomb, but Hilda didn't care what he had
      an air of; she was up in arms, and if he'd been Pope or Emperor it would
      have been just the same.</p>
      <p>&quot;Connie's looking awfully unwell,&quot; she said in her soft
      voice, fixing him with her beautiful, glowering grey eyes. She looked so
      maidenly, so did Connie; but he well knew the tone of Scottish obstinacy
      underneath.</p>
      <p>&quot;She's a little thinner,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Haven't you done anything about it?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you think it necessary?&quot; he asked, with his suavest
      English stiffness, for the two things often go together.</p>
      <p>Hilda only glowered at him without replying; repartee was not her
      forte, nor Connie's; so she glowered, and he was much more uncomfortable
      than if she had said things.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll take her to a doctor,&quot; said Hilda at length. `Can you
      suggest a good one round here?'</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm afraid I can't.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Then I'll take her to London, where we have a doctor we
      trust.&quot;</p>
      <p>Though boiling with rage, Clifford said nothing.</p>
      <p>&quot;I suppose I may as well stay the night,&quot; said Hilda, pulling
      off her gloves, &quot;and I'll drive her to town tomorrow.&quot;</p>
      <p>Clifford was yellow at the gills with anger, and at evening the whites
      of his eyes were a little yellow too. He ran to liver. But Hilda was
      consistently modest and maidenly.</p>
      <p>&quot;You must have a nurse or somebody, to look after you personally.
      You should really have a manservant,&quot; said Hilda as they sat, with
      apparent calmness, at coffee after dinner. She spoke in her soft,
      seemingly gentle way, but Clifford felt she was hitting him on the head
      with a bludgeon.</p>
      <p>&quot;You think so?&quot; he said coldly.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm sure! It's necessary. Either that, or Father and I must take
      Connie away for some months. This can't go on.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What can't go on?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Haven't you looked at the child!&quot; asked Hilda, gazing at him
      full stare. He looked rather like a huge, boiled crayfish at the moment;
      or so she thought.</p>
      <p>&quot;Connie and I will discuss it,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;I've already discussed it with her,&quot; said Hilda.</p>
      <p>Clifford had been long enough in the hands of nurses; he hated them,
      because they left him no real privacy. And a manservant!. . .he couldn't
      stand a man hanging round him. Almost better any woman. But why not
      Connie?</p>
      <p>The two sisters drove off in the morning, Connie looking rather like an
      Easter lamb, rather small beside Hilda, who held the wheel. Sir Malcolm
      was away, but the Kensington house was open.</p>
      <p>The doctor examined Connie carefully, and asked her all about her life.
      &quot;I see your photograph, and Sir Clifford's, in the illustrated papers
      sometimes. Almost notorieties, aren't you? That's how the quiet little
      girls grow up, though you're only a quiet little girl even now, in spite
      of the illustrated papers. No, no! There's nothing organically wrong, but
      it won't do! It won't do! Tell Sir Clifford he's got to bring you to town,
      or take you abroad, and amuse you. You've got to be amused, got to! Your
      vitality is much too low; no reserves, no reserves. The nerves of the
      heart a bit queer already: oh, yes! Nothing but nerves; I'd put you right
      in a month at Cannes or Biarritz. But it mustn't go on, <i>mustn't</i>, I
      tell you, or I won't be answerable for consequences. You're spending your
      life without renewing it. You've got to be amused, properly, healthily
      amused. You're spending your vitality without making any. Can't go on, you
      know. Depression! Avoid depression!&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda set her jaw, and that meant something.</p>
      <p>Michaelis heard they were in town, and came running with roses.
      &quot;Why, whatever's wrong?&quot; he cried. &quot;You're a shadow of
      yourself. Why, I never saw such a change! Why ever didn't you let me know?
      Come to Nice with me! Come down to Sicily! Go on, come to Sicily with me.
      It's lovely there just now. You want sun! You want life! Why, you're
      wasting away! Come away with me! Come to Africa! Oh, hang Sir Clifford!
      Chuck him, and come along with me. I'll marry you the minute he divorces
      you. Come along and try a life! God's love! That place Wragby would kill
      anybody. Beastly place! Foul place! Kill anybody! Come away with me into
      the sun! It's the sun you want, of course, and a bit of normal life.&quot;</p>
