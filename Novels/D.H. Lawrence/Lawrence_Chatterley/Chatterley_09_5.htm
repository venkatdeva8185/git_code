 <p>He realized now that the bitch-goddess of Success had two main
      appetites: one for flattery, adulation, stroking and tickling such as
      writers and artists gave her; but the other a grimmer appetite for meat
      and bones. And the meat and bones for the bitch-goddess were provided by
      the men who made money in industry.</p>
      <p>Yes, there were two great groups of dogs wrangling for the
      bitch-goddess: the group of the flatterers, those who offered her
      amusement, stories, films, plays: and the other, much less showy, much
      more savage breed, those who gave her meat, the real substance of money.
      The well-groomed showy dogs of amusement wrangled and snarled among
      themselves for the favours of the bitch-goddess. But it was nothing to the
      silent fight-to-the-death that went on among the indispensables, the
      bone-bringers.</p>
      <p>But under Mrs. Bolton's influence, Clifford was tempted to enter this
      other fight, to capture the bitch-goddess by brute means of industrial
      production. Somehow, he got his pecker up.&nbsp; In one way, Mrs. Bolton
      made a man of him, as Connie never did. Connie kept him apart, and made
      him sensitive and conscious of himself and his own states. Mrs. Bolton
      made hint aware only of outside things. Inwardly he began to go soft as
      pulp. But outwardly he began to be effective.</p>
      <p>He even roused himself to go to the mines once more: and when he was
      there, he went down in a tub, and in a tub he was hauled out into the
      workings. Things he had learned before the war, and seemed utterly to have
      forgotten, now came back to him. He sat there, crippled, in a tub, with
      the underground manager showing him the seam with a powerful torch. And he
      said little. But his mind began to work.</p>
      <p>He began to read again his technical works on the coal-mining industry,
      he studied the government reports, and he read with care the latest things
      on mining and the chemistry of coal and of shale which were written in
      German. Of course the most valuable discoveries were kept secret as far as
      possible. But once you started a sort of research in the field of
      coal-mining, a study of methods and means, a study of by-products and the
      chemical possibilities of coal, it was astounding the ingenuity and the
      almost uncanny cleverness of the modern technical mind, as if really the
      devil himself had lent fiend's wits to the technical scientists of
      industry. It was far more interesting than art, than literature, poor
      emotional half-witted stuff, was this technical science of industry. In
      this field, men were like gods, or demons, inspired to discoveries, and
      fighting to carry them out. In this activity, men were beyond any mental
      age calculable. But Clifford knew that when it did come to the emotional
      and human life, these self-made men were of a mental age of about
      thirteen, feeble boys. The discrepancy was enormous and appalling.</p>
      <p>But let that be. Let man slide down to general idiocy in the emotional
      and &quot;human&quot; mind, Clifford did not care. Let all that go hang.
      He was interested in the technicalities of modern coal-mining, and in
      pulling Tevershall out of the hole.</p>
      <p>He went down to the pit day after day, he studied, he put the general
      manager, and the overhead manager, and the underground manager, and the
      engineers through a mill they had never dreamed of. Power! He felt a new
      sense of power flowing through him: power over all these men, over the
      hundreds and hundreds of colliers. He was finding out: and he was getting
      things into his grip.</p>
      <p>And he seemed verily to be re-born. <i>Now</i> life came into him! He
      had been gradually dying, with Connie, in the isolated private life of the
      artist and the conscious being. Now let all that go. Let it sleep. He
      simply felt life rush into him out of the coal, out of the pit. The very
      stale air of the colliery was better than oxygen to him. It gave him a
      sense of power, power. He was doing something: and he was <i>going</i> to
      do something. He was going to win, to win: not as he had won with his
      stories, mere publicity, amid a whole sapping of energy and malice. But a
      man's victory.</p>
      <p>At first he thought the solution lay in electricity: convert the coal
      into electric power. Then a new idea came. The Germans invented a new
      locomotive engine with a self feeder, that did not need a fireman. And it
      was to be fed with a new fuel, that burnt in small quantities at a great
      heat, under peculiar conditions.</p>
      <p>The idea of a new concentrated fuel that burnt with a hard slowness at
      a fierce heat was what first attracted Clifford. There must be some sort
      of external stimulus of the burning of such fuel, not merely air supply.
      He began to experiment, and got a clever young fellow, who had proved
      brilliant in chemistry, to help him.</p>
      <p>And he felt triumphant. He had at last got out of himself. He had
      fulfilled his life-long secret yearning to get out of himself. Art had not
      done it for him. Art had only made it worse. But now, now he had done it.</p>
      <p>He was not aware how much Mrs. Bolton was behind him. He did not know
      how much he depended on her. But for all that, it was evident that when he
      was with her his voice dropped to an easy rhythm of intimacy, almost a
      trifle vulgar.</p>
      <p>With Connie, he was a little stiff. He felt he owed her everything, and
      he showed her the utmost respect and consideration, so long as she gave
      him mere outward respect. But it was obvious he had a secret dread of her.
      The new Achilles in hint had a heel, and in this heel the woman, the woman
      like Connie, his wife, could lame him fatally. He went in a certain
      half-subservient dread of her, and was extremely nice to her. But his
      voice was a little tense when he spoke to her, and he began to be silent
      whenever she was present.</p>
      <p>Only when he was alone with Mrs. Bolton did he really feel a lord and a
      master, and his voice ran on with her almost as easily and garrulously as
      her own could run. And he let her shave him or sponge all his body as if
      he were a child, really as if he were a child.</p>
