 <p>She had to make up her mind what to do. She would leave Venice on the
      Saturday that he was leaving Wragby: in six days' time. This would bring
      her to London on the Monday following, and she would then see him. She
      wrote to him to the London address, asking him to send her a letter to
      Hartland's hotel, and to call for her on the Monday evening at seven.</p>
      <p>Inside herself she was curiously and complicatedly angry, and all her
      responses were numb. She refused to confide even in Hilda, and Hilda,
      offended by her steady silence, had become rather intimate with a Dutch
      woman. Connie hated these rather stifling intimacies between women,
      intimacy into which Hilda always entered ponderously.</p>
      <p>Sir Malcolm decided to travel with Connie, and Duncan could come on
      with Hilda. The old artist always did himself well: he took berths on the
      Orient Express, in spite of Connie's dislike of <i>trains de luxe</i>, the
      atmosphere of vulgar depravity there is aboard them nowadays. However, it
      would make the journey to Paris shorter.</p>
      <p>Sir Malcolm was always uneasy going back to his wife. It was habit
      carried over from the first wife. But there would be a house-party for the
      grouse, and he wanted to be well ahead. Connie, sunburnt and handsome, sat
      in silence, forgetting all about the landscape.</p>
      <p>&quot;A little dull for you, going back to Wragby,&quot; said her
      father, noticing her glumness.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm not sure I shall go back to Wragby,&quot; she said, with
      startling abruptness, looking into his eyes with her big blue eyes. His
      big blue eyes took on the frightened look of a man whose social conscience
      is not quite clear.</p>
      <p>&quot;You mean you'll stay on in Paris a while?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! I mean never go back to Wragby.&quot;</p>
      <p>He was bothered by his own little problems, and sincerely hoped he was
      getting none of hers to shoulder.</p>
      <p>&quot;How's that, all at once?&quot; he asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm going to have a child.&quot;</p>
      <p>It was the first time she had uttered the words to any living soul, and
      it seemed to mark a cleavage in her life.</p>
      <p>&quot;How do you know?&quot; said her father.</p>
      <p>She smiled.</p>
      <p>&quot;How <i>should</i> I know?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But not Clifford's child, of course?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! Another man's.&quot;</p>
      <p>She rather enjoyed tormenting him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do I know the man?&quot; asked Sir Malcolm.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! You've never seen him.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was a long pause.</p>
      <p>&quot;And what are your plans?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know. That's the point.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No patching it up with Clifford?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I suppose Clifford would take it,&quot; said Connie. &quot;He
      told me, after last time you talked to him, he wouldn't mind if I had a
      child, so long as I went about it discreetly.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Only sensible thing he could say, under the circumstances. Then I
      suppose it'll be all right.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;In what way?&quot; said Connie, looking into her father's eyes.
      They were big blue eyes rather like her own, but with a certain uneasiness
      in them, a look sometimes of an uneasy little boy, sometimes a look of
      sullen selfishness, usually good-humoured and wary.</p>
      <p>&quot;You can present Clifford with an heir to all the Chatterleys, and
      put another baronet in Wragby.&quot;</p>
      <p>Sir Malcolm's face smiled with a half-sensual smile.</p>
      <p>&quot;But I don't think I want to,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why not? Feeling entangled with the other man? Well! If you want
      the truth from me, my child, it's this. The world goes on. Wragby stands
      and will go on standing. The world is more or less a fixed thing and,
      externally, we have to adapt ourselves to it. Privately, in my private
      opinion, we can please ourselves. Emotions change. You may like one man
      this year and another next. But Wragby still stands. Stick by Wragby as
      far as Wragby sticks by you. Then please yourself. But you'll get very
      little out of making a break. You can make a break if you wish. You have
      an independent income, the only thing that never lets you down. But you
      won't get much out of it. Put a little baronet in Wragby. It's an amusing
      thing to do.&quot;</p>
      <p>And Sir Malcolm sat back and smiled again. Connie did not answer.</p>
      <p>&quot;I hope you had a real man at last,&quot; he said to her after a
      while, sensually alert.</p>
      <p>&quot;I did. That's the trouble. There aren't many of them about,&quot;
      she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;No, by God!' he mused. &quot;There aren't! Well, my dear, to look
      at you, he was a lucky man. Surely he wouldn't make trouble for you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh no! He leaves me my own mistress entirely.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite! Quite! A genuine man would.&quot;</p>
      <p>Sir Malcolm was pleased. Connie was his favourite daughter, he had
      always liked the female in her. Not so much of her mother in her as in
      Hilda. And he had always disliked Clifford. So he was pleased, and very
      tender with his daughter, as if the unborn child were his child.</p>
      <p>He drove with her to Hartland's hotel, and saw her installed: then went
      round to his club. She had refused his company for the evening.</p>
      <p>She found a letter from Mellors. &quot;I won't come round to your
      hotel, but I'll wait for you outside the Golden Cock in Adam Street at
      seven.&quot;</p>
      <p>There he stood, tall and slender, and so different, in a formal suit of
      thin dark cloth. He had a natural distinction, but he had not the
      cut-to-pattern look of her class. Yet, she saw at once, he could go
      anywhere. He had a native breeding which was really much nicer than the
      cut-to-pattern class thing.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah, there you are! How well you look!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! But not you.&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked in his face anxiously. It was thin, and the cheekbones
      showed. But his eyes smiled at her, and she felt at home with him. There
      it was: suddenly, the tension of keeping up her appearances fell from her.
      Something flowed out of him physically, that made her feel inwardly at
      ease and happy, at home. With a woman's now alert instinct for happiness,
      she registered it at once. &quot;I'm happy when he's there!&quot; Not all
      the sunshine of Venice had given her this inward expansion and warmth.</p>
      <p>&quot;Was it horrid for you?&quot; she asked as she sat opposite him at
      table. He was too thin; she saw it now. His hand lay as she knew it, with
      the curious loose forgottenness of a sleeping animal. She wanted so much
      to take it and kiss it. But she did not quite dare.</p>
