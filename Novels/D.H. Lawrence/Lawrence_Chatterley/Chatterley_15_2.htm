 <p>&quot;And weren't you happy as an officer and a gentleman, when your
      Colonel was dead?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! They were a mingy lot.&quot; He laughed suddenly. &quot;The
      Colonel used to say: Lad, the English middle classes have to chew every
      mouthful thirty times because their guts are so narrow, a bit as big as a
      pea would give them a stoppage. They're the mingiest set of ladylike snipe
      ever invented: full of conceit of themselves, frightened even if their
      boot-laces aren't correct, rotten as high game, and always in the right.
      That's what finishes me up. Kow-tow, kow-tow, arse-licking till their
      tongues are tough: yet they're always in the right. Prigs on top of
      everything. Prigs! A generation of ladylike prigs with half a ball
      each---&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie laughed. The rain was rushing down.</p>
      <p>&quot;He hated them!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he. &quot;He didn't bother. He just disliked them.
      There's a difference. Because, as he said, the Tommies are getting just as
      priggish and half-balled and narrow-gutted. It's the fate of mankind, to
      go that way.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The common people too, the working people?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;All the lot. Their spunk is gone dead. Motor-cars and cinemas and
      aeroplanes suck that last bit out of them. I tell you, every generation
      breeds a more rabbity generation, with indiarubber tubing for guts and tin
      legs and tin faces. Tin people! It's all a steady sort of bolshevism just
      killing off the human thing, and worshipping the mechanical thing. Money,
      money, money! All the modern lot get their real kick out of killing the
      old human feeling out of man, making mincemeat of the old Adam and the old
      Eve. They're all alike. The world is all alike: kill off the human
      reality, a quid for every foreskin, two quid for each pair of balls. What
      is cunt but machine-fucking!---It's all alike. Pay 'em money to cut off
      the world's cock. Pay money, money, money to them that will take spunk out
      of mankind, and leave 'em all little twiddling machines.&quot;</p>
      <p>He sat there in the hut, his face pulled to mocking irony. Yet even
      then, he had one ear set backwards, listening to the storm over the wood.
      It made him feel so alone.</p>
      <p>&quot;But won't it ever come to an end?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, it will. It'll achieve its own salvation. When the last real
      man is killed, and they're <i>all</i> tame: white, black, yellow, all
      colours of tame ones: then they'll <i>all</i> be insane. Because the root
      of sanity is in the balls. Then they'll all be <i>insane</i>, and they'll
      make their grand <i>auto da fe</i>. You know <i>auto da fe</i> means <i>act
      of faith</i>? Ay, well, they'll make their own grand little act of faith.
      They'll offer one another up.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You mean kill one another?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I do, duckie! If we go on at our present rate then in a hundred
      years' time there won't be ten thousand people in this island: there may
      not be ten. They'll have lovingly wiped each other out. The thunder was
      rolling further away.</p>
      <p>&quot;How nice!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite nice! To contemplate the extermination of the human species
      and the long pause that follows before some other species crops up, it
      calms you more than anything else. And if we go on in this way, with
      everybody, intellectuals, artists, government, industrialists and workers
      all frantically killing off the last human feeling, the last bit of their
      intuition, the last healthy instinct; if it goes on in algebraical
      progression, as it is going on: then ta-tah! to the human species!
      Goodbye! darling! the serpent swallows itself and leaves a void,
      considerably messed up, but not hopeless. Very nice! When savage wild dogs
      bark in Wragby, and savage wild pit-ponies stamp on Tevershall pit-bank! <i>te
      deum laudamus</i>!&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie laughed, but not very happily.</p>
      <p>&quot;Then you ought to be pleased that they are all bolshevists,&quot;
      she said. &quot;You ought to be pleased that they hurry on towards the
      end.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;So I am. I don't stop 'em. Because I couldn't if I would.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Then why are you so bitter?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm not! If my cock gives its last crow, I don't mind.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But if you have a child?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>He dropped his head.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why,&quot; he said at last. &quot;It seems to me a wrong and
      bitter thing to do, to bring a child into this world.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! Don't say it! Don't say it!&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I think
      I'm going to have one. Say you'll he pleased.&quot; She laid her hand on
      his.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm pleased for you to be pleased,&quot; he said. &quot;But for
      me it seems a ghastly treachery to the unborn creature.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah no!&quot; she said, shocked. &quot;Then you <i>can't</i> ever
      really want me! <i>You can't</i> want me, if you feel that!&quot;</p>
      <p>Again he was silent, his face sullen. Outside there was only the
      threshing of the rain.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's not quite true!&quot; she whispered. &quot;It's not quite
      true! There's another truth.&quot; She felt he was bitter now partly
      because she was leaving him, deliberately going away to Venice. And this
      half pleased her.</p>
      <p>She pulled open his clothing and uncovered his belly, and kissed his
      navel. Then she laid her cheek on his belly and pressed her arm round his
      warm, silent loins. They were alone in the flood.</p>
      <p>&quot;Tell me you want a child, in hope!&quot; she murmured, pressing
      her face against his belly. &quot;Tell me you do!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why!&quot; he said at last: and she felt the curious quiver of
      changing consciousness and relaxation going through his body. &quot;Why
      I've thought sometimes if one but tried, here among th' colliers even!
      They're workin' bad now, an' not earnin' much. If a man could say to 'em:
      Dunna think o' nowt but th' money. When it comes ter <i>wants</i>, we want
      but little. Let's not live for money---&quot;</p>
      <p>She softly rubbed her cheek on his belly, and gathered his balls in her
      hand. The penis stirred softly, with strange life, but did not rise up.
      The rain beat bruisingly outside.</p>
      <p>&quot;Let's live for summat else. Let's not live ter make money,
      neither for us-selves nor for anybody else. Now we're forced to. We're
      forced to make a bit for us-selves, an' a fair lot for th' bosses. Let's
      stop it! Bit by bit, let's stop it. We needn't rant an' rave. Bit by bit,
      let's drop the whole industrial life an' go back. The least little bit o'
      money'll do. For everybody, me an' you, bosses an' masters, even th' king.
      The least little bit o' money'll really do. Just make up your mind to it,
      an' you've got out o' th' mess.&quot; He paused, then went on:</p>
