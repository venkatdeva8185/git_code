 <p>So she sauntered slowly back, listening. As she came near, the cottage
      looked just the same. A dog barked, and she knocked at the door, her heart
      beating in spite of herself.</p>
      <p>She heard the man coming lightly downstairs. He opened the door
      quickly, and startled her. He looked uneasy himself, but instantly a laugh
      came on his face.</p>
      <p>&quot;Lady Chatterley!&quot; he said. &quot;Will you come in?&quot;</p>
      <p>His manner was so perfectly easy and good, she stepped over the
      threshold into the rather dreary little room.</p>
      <p>&quot;I only called with a message from Sir Clifford,&quot; she said in
      her soft, rather breathless voice.</p>
      <p>The man was looking at her with those blue, all-seeing eyes of his,
      which made her turn her face aside a little. He thought her comely, almost
      beautiful, in her shyness, and he took command of the situation himself at
      once.</p>
      <p>&quot;Would you care to sit down?&quot; he asked, presuming she would
      not. The door stood open.</p>
      <p>&quot;No thanks! Sir Clifford wondered if you would. . .&quot; and she
      delivered her message, looking unconsciously into his eyes again. And now
      his eyes looked warm and kind, particularly to a woman, wonderfully warm,
      and kind, and at ease.</p>
      <p>&quot;Very good, your Ladyship. I will see to it at once.&quot;</p>
      <p>Taking an order, his whole self had changed, glazed over with a sort of
      hardness and distance. Connie hesitated, she ought to go. But she looked
      round the clean, tidy, rather dreary little sitting-room with something
      like dismay.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you live here quite alone?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite alone, your Ladyship.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But your mother. . .?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;She lives in her own cottage in the village.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;With the child?&quot; asked Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;With the child!&quot;</p>
      <p>And his plain, rather worn face took on an indefinable look of
      derision. It was a face that changed all the time, baffling.</p>
      <p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, seeing Connie stand at a loss, &quot;my mother
      comes and cleans up for me on Saturdays; I do the rest myself.&quot;</p>
      <p>Again Connie looked at him. His eyes were smiling again, a little
      mockingly, but warm and blue, and somehow kind. She wondered at him. He
      was in trousers and flannel shirt and a grey tie, his hair soft and damp,
      his face rather pale and worn-looking. When the eyes ceased to laugh they
      looked as if they had suffered a great deal, still without losing their
      warmth. But a pallor of isolation came over him, she was not really there
      for him.</p>
      <p>She wanted to say so many things, and she said nothing. Only she looked
      up at him again, and remarked:</p>
      <p>&quot;I hope I didn't disturb you?&quot;</p>
      <p>The faint smile of mockery narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;Only combing my hair, if you don't mind. I'm sorry I hadn't a
      coat on, but then I had no idea who was knocking. Nobody knocks here, and
      the unexpected sounds ominous.&quot;</p>
      <p>He went in front of her down the garden path to hold the gate. In his
      shirt, without the clumsy velveteen coat, she saw again how slender he
      was, thin, stooping a little. Yet, as she passed him, there was something
      young and bright in his fair hair, and his quick eyes. He would be a man
      about thirty-seven or eight.</p>
      <p>She plodded on into the wood, knowing he was looking after her; he
      upset her so much, in spite of herself.</p>
      <p>And he, as he went indoors, was thinking: &quot;She's nice, she's real!
      She's nicer than she knows.&quot;</p>
      <p>She wondered very much about him; he seemed so unlike a game-keeper, so
      unlike a working-man anyhow; although he had something in common with the
      local people. But also something very uncommon.</p>
      <p>&quot;The game-keeper, Mellors, is a curious kind of person,&quot; she
      said to Clifford; &quot;he might almost be a gentleman.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Might he?&quot; said Clifford. &quot;I hadn't noticed.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But isn't there something special about him?&quot; Connie
      insisted.</p>
      <p>&quot;I think he's quite a nice fellow, but I know very little about
      him. He only came out of the army last year, less than a year ago. From
      India, I rather think. He may have picked up certain tricks out there,
      perhaps he was an officer's servant, and improved on his position. Some of
      the men were like that. But it does them no good, they have to fall back
      into their old places when they get home again.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie gazed at Clifford contemplatively. She saw in him the peculiar
      tight rebuff against anyone of the lower classes who might be really
      climbing up, which she knew was characteristic of his breed.</p>
      <p>&quot;But don't you think there is something special about him?&quot;
      she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Frankly, no! Nothing I had noticed.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her curiously, uneasily, half-suspiciously. And she felt
      he wasn't telling her the real truth; he wasn't telling himself the real
      truth, that was it. He disliked any suggestion of a really exceptional
      human being. People must be more or less at his level, or below it.</p>
      <p>Connie felt again the tightness, niggardliness of the men of her
      generation. They were so tight, so scared of life!</p>
