 <p>&quot;Oh, I don't know. I'd come back from Venice. And then we'd
      prepare everything.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;How prepare?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I'd tell Clifford. I'd have to tell him.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Would you!&quot;</p>
      <p>He remained silent. She put her arms round his neck.</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't make it difficult for me,&quot; she pleaded.</p>
      <p>&quot;Make what difficult?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;For me to go to Venice and arrange things.&quot;</p>
      <p>A little smile, half a grin, flickered on his face.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't make it difficult,&quot; he said. &quot;I only want to
      find out just what you are after. But you don't really know yourself. You
      want to take time: get away and look at it. I don't blame you. I think
      you're wise. You may prefer to stay mistress of Wragby. I don't blame you.
      I've no Wragbys to offer. In fact, you know what you'll get out of me. No,
      no, I think you're right! I really do! And I'm not keen on coming to live
      on you, being kept by you. There's that too.&quot;</p>
      <p>She felt somehow as if he were giving her tit for tat.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you want me, don't you?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you want me?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You know I do. That's evident.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite! And <i>when</i> do you want me?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You know we can arrange it all when I come back. Now I'm out of
      breath with you. I must get calm and clear.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite! Get calm and clear!&quot;</p>
      <p>She was a little offended.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you trust me, don't you?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, absolutely!'</p>
      <p>She heard the mockery in his tone.</p>
      <p>&quot;Tell me then,&quot; she said flatly; &quot;do you think it would
      be better if I <i>don't</i> go to Venice?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm sure it's better if you do go to Venice,&quot; he replied in
      the cool, slightly mocking voice.</p>
      <p>&quot;You know it's next Thursday?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
      <p>She now began to muse. At last she said:</p>
      <p>&quot;And we <i>shall</i> know better where we are when I come back,
      shan't we?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh surely!&quot;</p>
      <p>The curious gulf of silence between them!</p>
      <p>&quot;I've been to the lawyer about my divorce,&quot; he said, a little
      constrainedly.</p>
      <p>She gave a slight shudder.</p>
      <p>&quot;Have you!&quot; she said. &quot;And what did he say?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;He said I ought to have done it before; that may be a difficulty.
      But since I was in the army, he thinks it will go through all right. If
      only it doesn't bring <i>her</i> down on my head!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Will she have to know?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! she is served with a notice: so is the man she lives with,
      the co-respondent.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Isn't it hateful, all the performances! I suppose I'd have to go
      through it with Clifford.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was a silence.</p>
      <p>&quot;And of course,&quot; he said, &quot;I have to live an exemplary
      life for the next six or eight months. So if you go to Venice, there's
      temptation removed for a week or two, at least.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Am I temptation!&quot; she said, stroking his face. &quot;I'm so
      glad I'm temptation to you! Don't let's think about it! You frighten me
      when you start thinking: you roll me out flat. Don't let's think about it.
      We can think so much when we are apart. That's the whole point! I've been
      thinking, I must come to you for another night before I go. I <i>must</i>
      come once more to the cottage. Shall I come on Thursday night?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Isn't that when your sister will be there?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! But she said we would start at tea-time. So we could start
      at tea-time. But she could sleep somewhere else and I could sleep with
      you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But then she'd have to know.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I shall tell her. I've more or less told her already. I must
      talk it all over with Hilda. She's a great help, so sensible.&quot;</p>
      <p>He was thinking of her plan.</p>
      <p>&quot;So you'd start off from Wragby at tea-time, as if you were going
      to London? Which way were you going?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;By Nottingham and Grantham.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And then your sister would drop you somewhere and you'd walk or
      drive back here? Sounds very risky, to me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Does it? Well, then, Hilda could bring me back. She could sleep
      at Mansfield, and bring me back here in the evening, and fetch me again in
      the morning. It's quite easy.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And the people who see you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll wear goggles and a veil.&quot;</p>
      <p>He pondered for some time.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well,&quot; he said. &quot;You please yourself as usual.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But wouldn't it please you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh yes! It'd please me all right,&quot; he said a little grimly.
      &quot;I might as well smite while the iron's hot.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you know what I thought?&quot; she said suddenly. &quot;It
      suddenly came to me. You are the &quot;&quot;Knight of the Burning
      Pestle''!'</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! And you? Are you the Lady of the Red-Hot Mortar?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; she said. &quot;Yes! You're Sir Pestle and I'm Lady
      Mortar.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;All right, then I'm knighted. John Thomas is Sir John, to your
      Lady Jane.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! John Thomas is knighted! I'm my-lady-maiden-hair, and you
      must have flowers too. Yes!&quot;</p>
      <p>She threaded two pink campions in the bush of red-gold hair above his
      penis.</p>
      <p>&quot;There!&quot; she said. &quot;Charming! Charming! Sir John!&quot;</p>
      <p>And she pushed a bit of forget-me-not in the dark hair of his breast.</p>
      <p>&quot;And you won't forget me there, will you?&quot; She kissed him on
      the breast, and made two bits of forget-me-not lodge one over each nipple,
      kissing him again.</p>
      <p>&quot;Make a calendar of me!&quot; he said. He laughed, and the flowers
      shook from his breast.</p>
      <p>&quot;Wait a bit!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>He rose, and opened the door of the hut. Flossie, lying in the porch,
      got up and looked at him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, it's me!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>The rain had ceased. There was a wet, heavy, perfumed stillness.
      Evening was approaching.</p>
      <p>He went out and down the little path in the opposite direction from the
      riding. Connie watched his thin, white figure, and it looked to her like a
      ghost, an apparition moving away from her.</p>
      <p>When she could see it no more, her heart sank. She stood in the door of
      the hut, with a blanket round her, looking into the drenched, motionless
      silence.</p>
