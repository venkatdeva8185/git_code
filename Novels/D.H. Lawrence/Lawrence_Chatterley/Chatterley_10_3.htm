 <p>Without knowing, he came quickly towards her and crouched beside her
      again, taking the chick from her hands, because she was afraid of the hen,
      and putting it back in the coop. At the back of his loins the lire
      suddenly darted stronger.</p>
      <p>He glanced apprehensively at her. Her face was averted, and she was
      crying blindly, in all the anguish of her generation's forlornness. His
      heart melted suddenly, like a drop of fire, and he put out his hand and
      laid his lingers on her knee.</p>
      <p>&quot;You shouldn't cry,&quot; he said softly.</p>
      <p>But then she put her hands over her face and felt that really her heart
      was broken and nothing mattered any more.</p>
      <p>He laid his hand on her shoulder, and softly, gently, it began to
      travel down the curve of her back, blindly, with a blind stroking motion,
      to the curve of her crouching loins. And there his hand softly, softly,
      stroked the curve of her flank, in the blind instinctive caress.</p>
      <p>She had found her scrap of handkerchief and was blindly trying to dry
      her face.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall you come to the hut?&quot; he said, in a quiet, neutral
      voice.</p>
      <p>And closing his hand softly on her upper arm, he drew her up and led
      her slowly to the hut, not letting go of her till she was inside. Then he
      cleared aside the chair and table, and took a brown, soldier's blanket
      from the tool chest, spreading it slowly. She glanced at his face, as she
      stood motionless.</p>
      <p>His face was pale and without expression, like that of a man submitting
      to fate.</p>
      <p>&quot;You lie there,&quot; he said softly, and he shut the door, so
      that it was dark, quite dark.</p>
      <p>With a queer obedience, she lay down on the blanket. Then she felt the
      soft, groping, helplessly desirous hand touching her body, feeling for her
      face. The hand stroked her face softly, softly, with infinite soothing and
      assurance, and at last there was the soft touch of a kiss on her cheek.</p>
      <p>She lay quite still, in a sort of sleep, in a sort of dream. Then she
      quivered as she felt his hand groping softly, yet with queer thwarted
      clumsiness, among her `clothing. Yet the hand knew, too, how to unclothe
      her where it wanted. He drew down the thin silk sheath, slowly, carefully,
      right down and over her feet. Then with a quiver of exquisite pleasure he
      touched the warm soft body, and touched her navel for a moment in a kiss.
      And he had to come in to her at once, to enter the peace on earth of her
      soft, quiescent body. It was the moment of pure peace for him, the entry
      into the body of the woman.</p>
      <p>She lay still, in a kind of sleep, always in a kind of sleep. The
      activity, the orgasm was his, all his; she could strive for herself no
      more. Even the tightness of his arms round her, even the intense movement
      of his body, and the springing of his seed in her, was a kind of sleep,
      from which she did not begin to rouse till he had finished and lay softly
      panting against her breast.</p>
      <p>Then she wondered, just dimly wondered, why? Why was this necessary?
      Why had it lifted a great cloud from her and given her peace? Was it real?
      Was it real?</p>
      <p>Her tormented modern-woman's brain still had no rest. Was it real? And
      she knew, if she gave herself to the man, it was real. But if she kept
      herself for herself it was nothing. She was old; millions of years old,
      she felt. And at last, she could bear the burden of herself no more. She
      was to be had for the taking. To be had for the taking.</p>
      <p>The man lay in a mysterious stillness. What was he feeling? What was he
      thinking? She did not know. He was a strange man to her, she did not know
      him. She must only wait, for she did not dare to break his mysterious
      stillness. He lay there with his arms round her, his body on hers, his wet
      body touching hers, so close. And completely unknown. Yet not unpeaceful.
      His very stillness was peaceful.</p>
      <p>She knew that, when at last he roused and drew away from her. It was
      like an abandonment. He drew her dress in the darkness down over her knees
      and stood a few moments, apparently adjusting his own clothing. Then he
      quietly opened the door and went out.</p>
      <p>She saw a very brilliant little moon shining above the afterglow over
      the oaks. Quickly she got up and arranged herself she was tidy. Then she
      went to the door of the hut.</p>
      <p>All the lower wood was in shadow, almost darkness. Yet the sky overhead
      was crystal. But it shed hardly any light. He came through the lower
      shadow towards her, his face lifted like a pale blotch.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall we go then?&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll go with you to the gate.&quot;</p>
      <p>He arranged things his own way. He locked the door of the hut and came
      after her.</p>
      <p>&quot;You aren't sorry, are you?&quot; he asked, as he went at her
      side.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! No! Are you?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;For that! No!&quot; he said. Then after a while he added:
      &quot;But there's the rest of things.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What rest of things?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Sir Clifford. Other folks. All the complications.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why complications?&quot; she said, disappointed.</p>
      <p>`It's always so. For you as well as for me. There's always
      complications.&quot; He walked on steadily in the dark.</p>
      <p>&quot;And are you sorry?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;In a way!&quot; he replied, looking up at the sky. &quot;I
      thought I'd done with it all. Now I've begun again.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Begun what?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Life.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Life!&quot; she re-echoed, with a queer thrill.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's life,&quot; he said. &quot;There's no keeping clear. And if
      you do keep clear you might almost as well die. So if I've got to be
      broken open again, I have.&quot;</p>
      <p>She did not quite see it that way, but still. . .</p>
      <p>&quot;It's just love,&quot; she said cheerfully.</p>
      <p>&quot;Whatever that may be,&quot; he replied.</p>
      <p>They went on through the darkening wood in silence, till they were
      almost at the gate.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you don't hate me, do you?&quot; she said wistfully.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; he replied. And suddenly he held her fast against
      his breast again, with the old connecting passion. &quot;Nay, for me it
      was good, it was good. Was it for you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, for me too,&quot; she answered, a little untruthfully, for
      she had not been conscious of much.</p>
      <p>He kissed her softly, softly, with the kisses of warmth.</p>
      <p>&quot;If only there weren't so many other people in the world,&quot; he
      said lugubriously.</p>
      <p>She laughed. They were at the gate to the park. He opened it for her.</p>
      <p>&quot;I won't come any further,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;No!&quot; And she held out her hand, as if to shake hands. But he
      took it in both his.</p>
