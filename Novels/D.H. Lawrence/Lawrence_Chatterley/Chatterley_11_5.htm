 <p>But Leslie Winter was alone. He had adored his house. But his park was
      bordered by three of his own collieries. He had been a generous man in his
      ideas. He had almost welcomed the colliers in his park. Had the miners not
      made him rich! So, when he saw the gangs of unshapely men lounging by his
      ornamental waters---not in the <i>private</i> part of the park, no, he
      drew the line there---he would say: &quot;the miners are perhaps not so
      ornamental as deer, but they are far more profitable.&quot;</p>
      <p>But that was in the golden---monetarily---latter half of Queen
      Victoria's reign. Miners were then &quot;good working men&quot;.</p>
      <p>Winter had made this speech, half apologetic, to his guest, the then
      Prince of Wales. And the Prince had replied, in his rather guttural
      English:</p>
      <p>&quot;You are quite right. If there were coal under Sandringham, I
      would open a mine on the lawns, and think it first-rate landscape
      gardening. Oh, I am quite willing to exchange roe-deer for colliers, at
      the price. Your men are good men too, I hear.&quot;</p>
      <p>But then, the Prince had perhaps an exaggerated idea of the beauty of
      money, and the blessings of industrialism.</p>
      <p>However, the Prince had been a King, and the King had died, and now
      there was another King, whose chief function seemed to be to open
      soup-kitchens.</p>
      <p>And the good working men were somehow hemming Shipley in. New mining
      villages crowded on the park, and the squire felt somehow that the
      population was alien. He used to feel, in a good-natured but quite grand
      way, lord of his own domain and of his own colliers. Now, by a subtle
      pervasion of the new spirit, he had somehow been pushed out. It was he who
      did not belong any more. There was no mistaking it. The mines, the
      industry, had a will of its own, and this will was against the
      gentleman-owner. All the colliers took part in the will, and it was hard
      to live up against it. It either shoved you out of the place, or out of
      life altogether.</p>
      <p>Squire Winter, a soldier, had stood it out. But he no longer cared to
      walk in the park after dinner. He almost hid, indoors. Once he had walked,
      bare-headed, and in his patent-leather shoes and purple silk socks, with
      Connie down to the gate, talking to her in his well-bred rather haw-haw
      fashion. But when it came to passing the little gangs of colliers who
      stood and stared without either salute or anything else, Connie felt how
      the lean, well-bred old man winced, winced as an elegant antelope stag in
      a cage winces from the vulgar stare. The colliers were not <i>personally</i>
      hostile: not at all. But their spirit was cold, and shoving him out. And,
      deep down, there was a profound grudge. They `worked for him'. And in
      their ugliness, they resented his elegant, well-groomed, well-bred
      existence. `Who's he!' It was the <i>difference</i> they resented.</p>
      <p>And somewhere, in his secret English heart, being a good deal of a
      soldier, he believed they were right to resent the difference. He felt
      himself a little in the wrong, for having all the advantages. Nevertheless
      he represented a system, and he would not be shoved out.</p>
      <p>Except by death. Which came on him soon after Connie's call, suddenly.
      And he remembered Clifford handsomely in his will.</p>
      <p>The heirs at once gave out the order for the demolishing of Shipley. It
      cost too much to keep up. No one would live there. So it was broken up.
      The avenue of yews was cut down. The park was denuded of its timber, and
      divided into lots. It was near enough to Uthwaite. In the strange, bald
      desert of this still-one-more no-man's-land, new little streets of
      semi-detached were run up, very desirable! The Shipley Hall Estate!</p>
      <p>Within a year of Connie's last call, it had happened. There stood
      Shipley Hall Estate, an array of red-brick semi-detached `villas' in new
      streets. No one would have dreamed that the stucco hall had stood there
      twelve months before.</p>
      <p>But this is a later stage of King Edward's landscape gardening, the
      sort that has an ornamental coal-mine on the lawn.</p>
      <p>One England blots out another. The England of the Squire Winters and
      the Wragby Halls was gone, dead. The blotting out was only not yet
      complete.</p>
      <p>What would come after? Connie could not imagine. She could only see the
      new brick streets spreading into the fields, the new erections rising at
      the collieries, the new girls in their silk stockings, the new collier
      lads lounging into the Pally or the Welfare. The younger generation were
      utterly unconscious of the old England. There was a gap in the continuity
      of consciousness, almost American: but industrial really. What next?</p>
      <p>Connie always felt there was no next. She wanted to hide her head in
      the sand: or, at least, in the bosom of a living man.</p>
      <p>The world was so complicated and weird and gruesome! The common people
      were so many, and really so terrible. So she bought as she was going home,
      and saw the colliers trailing from the pits, grey-black, distorted, one
      shoulder higher than the other, slurring their heavy ironshod boots.
      Underground grey faces, whites of eyes rolling, necks cringing from the
      pit roof, shoulders Out of shape. Men! Men! Alas, in some ways patient and
      good men. In other ways, non-existent. Something that men <i>should</i>
      have was bred and killed out of them. Yet they were men. They begot
      children. One might bear a child to them. Terrible, terrible thought! They
      were good and kindly. But they were only half, Only the grey half of a
      human being. As yet, they were &quot;good&quot;. But even that was the
      goodness of their halfness. Supposing the dead in them ever rose up! But
      no, it was too terrible to think of. Connie was absolutely afraid of the
      industrial masses. They seemed so <i>weird</i> to her. A life with utterly
      no beauty in it, no intuition, always &quot;in the pit&quot;.</p>
      <p>Children from such men! Oh God, oh God!</p>
      <p>Yet Mellors had come from such a father. Not quite. Forty years had
      made a difference, an appalling difference in manhood. The iron and the
      coal had eaten deep into the bodies and souls of the men.</p>
