 <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; she said, kissing him mockingly. &quot;Let's have them <i>sautées</i>.&quot;
      He laughed, and sat erect.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's a fact!&quot; he said. &quot;Anything for a bit of
      warm-heartedness. But the women don't like it. Even you don't really like
      it. You like good, sharp, piercing cold-hearted fucking, and then
      pretending it's all sugar. Where's your tenderness for me? You're as
      suspicious of me as a cat is of a dog. I tell you it takes two even to be
      tender and warm-hearted. You love fucking all right: but you want it to be
      called something grand and mysterious, just to flatter your own
      self-importance. Your own self-importance is more to you, fifty times
      more, than any man, or being together with a man.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But that's what I'd say of you. Your own self-importance is
      everything to you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! Very well then!&quot; he said, moving as if he wanted to
      rise. &quot;Let's keep apart then. I'd rather die than do any more
      cold-hearted fucking.&quot;</p>
      <p>She slid away from him, and he stood up.</p>
      <p>&quot;And do you think <i>I</i> want it?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;I hope you don't,&quot; he replied. &quot;But anyhow, you go to
      bed an' I'll sleep down here.&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked at him. He was pale, his brows were sullen, he was as
      distant in recoil as the cold pole. Men were all alike.</p>
      <p>&quot;I can't go home till morning,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! Go to bed. It's a quarter to one.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I certainly won't,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>He went across and picked up his boots.</p>
      <p>&quot;Then I'll go out!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>He began to put on his boots. She stared at him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Wait!&quot; she faltered. &quot;Wait! What's come between
      us?&quot;</p>
      <p>He was bent over, lacing his boot, and did not reply. The moments
      passed. A dimness came over her, like a swoon. All her consciousness died,
      and she stood there wide-eyed, looking at him from the unknown, knowing
      nothing any more.</p>
      <p>He looked up, because of the silence, and saw her wide-eyed and lost.
      And as if a wind tossed him he got up and hobbled over to her, one shoe
      off and one shoe on, and took her in his arms, pressing her against his
      body, which somehow felt hurt right through. And there he held her, and
      there she remained.</p>
      <p>Till his hands reached blindly down and felt for her, and felt under
      the clothing to where she was smooth and warm.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ma lass!&quot; he murmured. &quot;Ma little lass! Dunna let's
      light! Dunna let's niver light! I love thee an' th' touch on thee. Dunna
      argue wi' me! Dunna! Dunna! Dunna! Let's be together.&quot;</p>
      <p>She lifted her face and looked at him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't be upset,&quot; she said steadily. &quot;It's no good being
      upset. Do you really want to be together with me?&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked with wide, steady eyes into his face. He stopped, and went
      suddenly still, turning his face aside. All his body went perfectly still,
      but did not withdraw.</p>
      <p>Then he lifted his head and looked into her eyes, with his odd, faintly
      mocking grin, saying: &quot;Ay-ay! Let's be together on oath.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But really?&quot; she said, her eyes filling with tears. &quot;Ay
      really! Heart an' belly an' cock.&quot;</p>
      <p>He still smiled faintly down at her, with the flicker of irony in his
      eyes, and a touch of bitterness.</p>
      <p>She was silently weeping, and he lay with her and went into her there
      on the hearthrug, and so they gained a measure of equanimity. And then
      they went quickly to bed, for it was growing chill, and they had tired
      each other out. And she nestled up to him, feeling small and enfolded, and
      they both went to sleep at once, fast in one sleep. And so they lay and
      never moved, till the sun rose over the wood and day was beginning.</p>
      <p>Then he woke up and looked at the light. The curtains were drawn. He
      listened to the loud wild calling of blackbirds and thrushes in the wood.
      It would be a brilliant morning, about half past five, his hour for
      rising. He had slept so fast! It was such a new day! The woman was still
      curled asleep and tender. His hand moved on her, and she opened her blue
      wondering eyes, smiling unconsciously into his face.</p>
      <p>&quot;Are you awake?&quot; she said to him.</p>
      <p>He was looking into her eyes. He smiled, and kissed her. And suddenly
      she roused and sat up.</p>
      <p>&quot;Fancy that I am here!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>She looked round the whitewashed little bedroom with its sloping
      ceiling and gable window where the white curtains were closed. The room
      was bare save for a little yellow-painted chest of drawers, and a chair:
      and the smallish white bed in which she lay with him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Fancy that we are here!&quot; she said, looking down at him. He
      was lying watching her, stroking her breasts with his fingers, under the
      thin nightdress. When he was warm and smoothed out, he looked young and
      handsome. His eyes could look so warm. And she was fresh and young like a
      flower.</p>
      <p>&quot;I want to take this off!&quot; she said, gathering the thin
      batiste nightdress and pulling it over her head. She sat there with bare
      shoulders and longish breasts faintly golden. He loved to make her breasts
      swing softly, like bells.</p>
      <p>&quot;You must take off your pajamas too,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Eh, nay!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; she commanded.</p>
      <p>And he took off his old cotton pajama-jacket, and pushed down the
      trousers. Save for his hands and wrists and face and neck he was white as
      milk, with fine slender muscular flesh. To Connie he was suddenly
      piercingly beautiful again, as when she had seen him that afternoon
      washing himself.</p>
      <p>Gold of sunshine touched the closed white curtain. She felt it wanted
      to come in.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, do let's draw the curtains! The birds are singing so! Do let
      the sun in,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>He slipped out of bed with his back to her, naked and white and thin,
      and went to the window, stooping a little, drawing the curtains and
      looking out for a moment. The back was white and fine, the small buttocks
      beautiful with an exquisite, delicate manliness, the back of the neck
      ruddy and delicate and yet strong.</p>
      <p>There was an inward, not an outward strength in the delicate fine body.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you are beautiful!&quot; she said. &quot;So pure and fine!
      Come!&quot; She held her arms out.</p>
      <p>He was ashamed to turn to her, because of his aroused nakedness.</p>
      <p>He caught his shirt off the floor, and held it to him, coming to her.</p>
      <p>&quot;No!&quot; she said still holding out her beautiful slim arms from
      her dropping breasts. &quot;Let me see you!&quot;</p>
      <p>He dropped the shirt and stood still looking towards her. The sun
      through the low window sent in a beam that lit up his thighs and slim
      belly and the erect phallos rising darkish and hot-looking from the little
      cloud of vivid gold-red hair. She was startled and afraid.</p>
      <p>&quot;How strange!&quot; she said slowly. &quot;How strange he stands
      there! So big! and so dark and cock-sure! Is he like that?&quot;</p>
