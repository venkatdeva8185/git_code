 <p>&quot;Oh, nothing, really! But I don't think he wanted me to have the
      freedom of the castle, quite.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't suppose he did.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Still, I don't see why he should mind. It's not his home, after
      all! It's not his private abode. I don't see why I shouldn't sit there if
      I want to.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite!&quot; said Clifford. &quot;He thinks too much of himself,
      that man.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you think he does?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, decidedly! He thinks he's something exceptional. You know he
      had a wife he didn't get on with, so he joined up in 1915 and was sent to
      India, I believe. Anyhow he was blacksmith to the cavalry in Egypt for a
      time; always was connected with horses, a clever fellow that way. Then
      some Indian colonel took a fancy to him, and he was made a lieutenant.
      Yes, they gave him a commission. I believe he went back to India with his
      colonel, and up to the north-west frontier. He was ill; he was a pension.
      He didn't come out of the army till last year, I believe, and then,
      naturally, it isn't easy for a man like that to get back to his own level.
      He's bound to flounder. But he does his duty all right, as far as I'm
      concerned. Only I'm not having any of the Lieutenant Mellors touch.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;How could they make him an officer when he speaks broad
      Derbyshire?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;He doesn't. . .except by fits and starts. He can speak perfectly
      well, for him. I suppose he has an idea if he's come down to the ranks
      again, he'd better speak as the ranks speak.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why didn't you tell me about him before?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I've no patience with these romances. They're the ruin of all
      order. It's a thousand pities they ever happened.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie was inclined to agree. What was the good of discontented people
      who fitted in nowhere?</p>
      <p>In the spell of fine weather Clifford, too, decided to go to the wood.
      The wind was cold, but not so tiresome, and the sunshine was like life
      itself, warm and full.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's amazing,&quot; said Connie, &quot;how different one feels
      when there's a really fresh fine day. Usually one feels the very air is
      half dead. People are killing the very air.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you think people are doing it?&quot; he asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;I do. The steam of so much boredom, and discontent and anger out
      of all the people, just kills the vitality in the air. I'm sure of
      it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps some condition of the atmosphere lowers the vitality of
      the people?&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;No, it's man that poisons the universe,&quot; she asserted.</p>
      <p>&quot;Fouls his own nest,&quot; remarked Clifford.</p>
      <p>The chair puffed on. In the hazel copse catkins were hanging pale gold,
      and in sunny places the wood-anemones were wide open, as if exclaiming
      with the joy of life, just as good as in past days, when people could
      exclaim along with them. They had a faint scent of apple-blossom. Connie
      gathered a few for Clifford.</p>
      <p>He took them and looked at them curiously.</p>
      <p>&quot;Thou still unravished bride of quietness,&quot; he quoted.
      &quot;It seems to fit flowers so much better than Greek vases.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ravished is such a horrid word!&quot; she said. &quot;It's only
      people who ravish things.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I don't know. . .snails and things,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Even snails only eat them, and bees don't ravish.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was angry with him, turning everything into words. Violets were
      Juno's eyelids, and windflowers were on ravished brides. How she hated
      words, always coming between her and life: they did the ravishing, if
      anything did: ready-made words and phrases, sucking all the life-sap out
      of living things.</p>
      <p>The walk with Clifford was not quite a success. Between him and Connie
      there was a tension that each pretended not to notice, but there it was.
      Suddenly, with all the force of her female instinct, she was shoving him
      off. She wanted to be clear of him, and especially of his consciousness,
      his words, his obsession with himself, his endless treadmill obsession
      with himself, and his own words.</p>
      <p>The weather came rainy again. But after a day or two she went out in
      the rain, and she went to the wood. And once there, she went towards the
      hut. It was raining, but not so cold, and the wood felt so silent and
      remote, inaccessible in the dusk of rain.</p>
      <p>She came to the clearing. No one there! The hut was locked. But she sat
      on the log doorstep, under the rustic porch, and snuggled into her own
      warmth. So she sat, looking at the rain, listening to the many noiseless
      noises of it, and to the strange soughings of wind in upper branches, when
      there seemed to be no wind. Old oak-trees stood around, grey, powerful
      trunks, rain-blackened, round and vital, throwing off reckless limbs. The
      ground was fairly free of undergrowth, the anemones sprinkled, there was a
      bush or two, elder, or guelder-rose, and a purplish tangle of bramble: the
      old russet of bracken almost vanished under green anemone ruffs. Perhaps
      this was one of the unravished places. Unravished! The whole world was
      ravished.</p>
      <p>Some things can't be ravished. You can't ravish a tin of sardines. And
      so many women are like that; and men. But the earth. . .!</p>
      <p>The rain was abating. It was hardly making darkness among the oaks any
      more. Connie wanted to go; yet she sat on. But she was getting cold; yet
      the overwhelming inertia of her inner resentment kept her there as if
      paralysed.</p>
      <p>Ravished! How ravished one could be without ever being touched.
      Ravished by dead words become obscene, and dead ideas become obsessions.</p>
      <p>A wet brown dog came running and did not bark, lifting a wet feather of
      a tail. The man followed in a wet black oilskin jacket, like a chauffeur,
      and face flushed a little. She felt him recoil in his quick walk, when he
      saw her. She stood up in the handbreadth of dryness under the rustic
      porch. He saluted without speaking, coming slowly near. She began to
      withdraw.</p>
