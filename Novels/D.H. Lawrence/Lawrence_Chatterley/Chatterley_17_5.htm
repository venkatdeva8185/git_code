 <p>She had a revulsion against the whole affair, and almost envied the
      Guthrie girls their gawky inexperience and crude maidenliness. And she now
      dreaded the thought that anybody would know about herself and the keeper.
      How unspeakably humiliating! She was weary, afraid, and felt a craving for
      utter respectability, even for the vulgar and deadening respectability of
      the Guthrie girls. If Clifford knew about her affair, how unspeakably
      humiliating! She was afraid, terrified of society and its unclean bite.
      She almost wished she could get rid of the child again, and be quite
      clear. In short, she fell into a state of funk.</p>
      <p>As for the scent-bottle, that was her own folly. She had not been able
      to refrain from perfuming his one or two handkerchiefs and his shirts in
      the drawer, just out of childishness, and she had left a little bottle of
      Coty's Wood-violet perfume, half empty, among his things. She wanted him
      to remember her in the perfume. As for the cigarette-ends, they were
      Hilda's.</p>
      <p>She could not help confiding a little in Duncan Forbes. She didn't say
      she had been the keeper's lover, she only said she liked him, and told
      Forbes the history of the man.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Forbes, &quot;you'll see, they'll never rest till
      they've pulled the man down and done him its. If he has refused to creep
      up into the middle classes, when he had a chance; and if he's a man who
      stands up for his own sex, then they'll do him in. It's the one thing they
      won't let you be, straight and open in your sex. You can be as dirty as
      you like. In fact the more dirt you do on sex the better they like it. But
      if you believe in your own sex, and won't have it done dirt to: they'll
      down you. It's the one insane taboo left: sex as a natural and vital
      thing. They won't have it, and they'll kill you before they'll let you
      have it. You'll see, they'll hound that man down. And what's he done,
      after all? If he's made love to his wife all ends on, hasn't he a right
      to? She ought to be proud of it. But you see, even a low bitch like that
      turns on him, and uses the hyena instinct of the mob against sex, to pull
      him down. You have a snivel and feel sinful or awful about your sex,
      before you're allowed to have any. Oh, they'll hound the poor devil
      down.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie had a revulsion in the opposite direction now. What had he done,
      after all? what had he done to herself, Connie, but give her an exquisite
      pleasure and a sense of freedom and life? He had released her warm,
      natural sexual flow. And for that they would hound him down.</p>
      <p>No no, it should not be. She saw the image of him, naked white with
      tanned face and hands, looking down and addressing his erect penis as if
      it were another being, the odd grin flickering on his face. And she heard
      his voice again: Tha's got the nicest woman's arse of anybody! And she
      felt his hand warmly and softly closing over her tail again, over her
      secret places, like a benediction. And the warmth ran through her womb,
      and the little flames flickered in her knees, and she said: Oh, no! I
      mustn't go back on it! I must not go back on him. I must stick to him and
      to what I had of him, through everything. I had no warm, flamy life till
      he gave it me. And I won't go back on it.</p>
      <p>She did a rash thing. She sent a letter to Ivy Bolton, enclosing a note
      to the keeper, and asking Mrs. Bolton to give it him. And she wrote to
      him: &quot;I am very much distressed to hear of all the trouble your wife
      is making for you, but don't mind it, it is only a sort of hysteria. It
      will all blow over as suddenly as it came. But I'm awfully sorry about it,
      and I do hope you are not minding very much. After all, it isn't worth it.
      She is only a hysterical woman who wants to hurt you. I shall be home in
      ten days' time, and I do hope everything will be all right.&quot;</p>
      <p>A few days later came a letter from Clifford. He was evidently upset.</p>
      <p>&quot;I am delighted to hear you are prepared to leave Venice on the
      sixteenth. But if you are enjoying it, don't hurry home. We miss you,
      Wragby misses you. But it is essential that you should get your full
      amount of sunshine, sunshine and pajamas, as the advertisements of the
      Lido say. So please do stay on a little longer, if it is cheering you up
      and preparing you for our sufficiently awful winter. Even today, it rains.</p>
      <p>I am assiduously, admirably looked after by Mrs. Bolton. She is a queer
      specimen. The more I live, the more I realize what strange creatures human
      beings are. Some of them might Just as well have a hundred legs, like a
      centipede, or six, like a lobster. The human consistency and dignity one
      has been led to expect from one's fellow-men seem actually nonexistent.
      One doubts if they exist to any startling degree even is oneself.</p>
      <p>The scandal of the keeper continues and gets bigger like a snowball.
      Mrs. Bolton keeps me informed. She reminds me of a fish which, though
      dumb, seems to be breathing silent gossip through its gills, while ever it
      lives. All goes through the sieve of her gills, and nothing surprises her.
      It is as if the events of other people's lives were the necessary oxygen
      of her own.</p>
      <p>She is preoccupied with tie Mellors scandal, and if I will let her
      begin, she takes me down to the depths. Her great indignation, which even
      then is like the indignation of an actress playing a role, is against the
      wife of Mellors, whom she persists in calling Bertha Courts. I have been
      to the depths of the muddy lies of the Bertha Couttses of this world, and
      when, released from the current of gossip, I slowly rise to the surface
      again, I look at the daylight its wonder that it ever should be.</p>
      <p>It seems to me absolutely true, that our world, which appears to us the
      surface of all things, is really the <i>bottom</i> of a deep ocean: all
      our trees are submarine growths, and we are weird, scaly-clad submarine
      fauna, feeding ourselves on offal like shrimps. Only occasionally the soul
      rises gasping through the fathomless fathoms under which we live, far up
      to the surface of the ether, where there is true air. I am convinced that
      the air we normally breathe is a kind of water, and men and women are a
      species of fish.</p>
      <p>But sometimes the soul does come up, shoots like a kittiwake into the
      light, with ecstasy, after having preyed on the submarine depths. It is
      our mortal destiny, I suppose, to prey upon the ghastly subaqueous life of
      our fellow-men, in the submarine jungle of mankind. But our immortal
      destiny is to escape, once we have swallowed our swimmy catch, up again
      into the bright ether, bursting out from the surface of Old Ocean into
      real light. Then one realizes one's eternal nature.</p>
