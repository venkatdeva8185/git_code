 <p>&quot;I quite believe it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;If he'd been sitting in a chair with paralysed legs, and behaved
      as you behaved, what would you have done for <i>him</i>?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;My dear evangelist, this confusing of persons and personalities
      is in bad taste.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And your nasty, sterile want of common sympathy is in the worst
      taste imaginable. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>! You and your ruling class!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And to what should it oblige me? To have a lot of unnecessary
      emotions about my game-keeper? I refuse. I leave it all to my
      evangelist.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;As if he weren't a man as much as you are, my word!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;My game-keeper to boot, and I pay him two pounds a week and give
      him a house.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Pay him! What do you think you pay for, with two pounds a week
      and a house?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;His services.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Bah! I would tell you to keep your two pounds a week and your
      house.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Probably he would like to: but can't afford the luxury!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You, and <i>rule</i>!&quot; she said. &quot;You don't rule, don't
      flatter yourself. You have only got more than your share of the money, and
      make people work for you for two pounds a week, or threaten them with
      starvation. Rule! What do you give forth of rule? Why, you re dried up!
      You only bully with your money, like any Jew or any Schieber!'&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You are very elegant in your speech, Lady Chatterley!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I assure you, you were very elegant altogether out there in the
      wood. I was utterly ashamed of you. Why, my father is ten times the human
      being you are: you <i>gentleman</i>!&quot;</p>
      <p>He reached and rang the bell for Mrs. Bolton. But he was yellow at the
      gills.</p>
      <p>She went up to her room, furious, saying to herself: &quot;Him and
      buying people! Well, he doesn't buy me, and therefore there's no need for
      me to stay with him. Dead fish of a gentleman, with his celluloid soul!
      And how they take one in, with their manners and their mock wistfulness
      and gentleness. They've got about as much feeling as celluloid has.&quot;</p>
      <p>She made her plans for the night, and determined to get Clifford off
      her mind. She didn't want to hate him. She didn't want to be mixed up very
      intimately with him in any sort of feeling. She wanted him not to know
      anything at all about herself: and especially, not to know anything about
      her feeling for the keeper. This squabble of her attitude to the servants
      was an old one. He found her too familiar, she found him stupidly
      insentient, tough and indiarubbery where other people were concerned.</p>
      <p>She went downstairs calmly, with her old demure bearing, at
      dinner-time. He was still yellow at the gills: in for one of his liver
      bouts, when he was really very queer.---He was reading a French book.</p>
      <p>&quot;Have you ever read Proust?'&quot; he asked her.</p>
      <p>&quot;I've tried, but he bores me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;He's really very extraordinary.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Possibly! But he bores me: all that sophistication! He doesn't
      have feelings, he only has streams of words about feelings. I'm tired of
      self-important mentalities.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Would you prefer self-important animalities?'&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps! But one might possibly get something that wasn't
      self-important.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, I like Proust's subtlety and his well-bred anarchy.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;It makes you very dead, really.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;There speaks my evangelical little wife.&quot;</p>
      <p>They were at it again, at it again! But she couldn't help fighting him.
      He seemed to sit there like a skeleton, sending out a skeleton's cold
      grizzly <i>will</i> against her. Almost she could feel the skeleton
      clutching her and pressing her to its cage of ribs. He too was really up
      in arms: and she was a little afraid of him.</p>
      <p>She went upstairs as soon as possible, and went to bed quite early. But
      at half past nine she got up, and went outside to listen. There was no
      sound. She slipped on a dressing-gown and went downstairs. Clifford and
      Mrs. Bolton were playing cards, gambling. They would probably go on until
      midnight.</p>
      <p>Connie returned to her room, threw her pajamas on the tossed bed, put
      on a thin tennis-dress and over that a woolen day-dress, put on rubber
      tennis-shoes, and then a light coat. And she was ready. If she met
      anybody, she was just going out for a few minutes. And in the morning,
      when she came in again, she would just have been for a little walk in the
      dew, as she fairly often did before breakfast. For the rest, the only
      danger was that someone should go into her room during the night. But that
      was most unlikely: not one chance in a hundred.</p>
      <p>Betts had not locked up. He fastened up the house at ten o'clock, and
      unfastened it again at seven in the morning. She slipped out silently and
      unseen. There was a half-moon shining, enough to make a little light in
      the world, not enough to show her up in her dark-grey coat. She walked
      quickly across the park, not really in the thrill of the assignation, but
      with a certain anger and rebellion burning in her heart. It was not the
      right sort of heart to take to a love-meeting. But <i>à la guerre comme
      à la guerre</i>!</p>
