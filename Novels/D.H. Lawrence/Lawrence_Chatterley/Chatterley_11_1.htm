 <p>Connie was sorting out one of the Wragby lumber rooms. There were
      several: the house was a warren, and the family never sold anything. Sir
      Geoffery's father had liked pictures and Sir Geoffery's mother had liked <i>cinquecento</i>
      furniture. Sir Geoffery himself had liked old carved oak chests, vestry
      chests. So it went on through the generations. Clifford collected very
      modern pictures, at very moderate prices.</p>
      <p>So in the lumber room there were bad Sir Edwin Landseers and pathetic
      William Henry Hunt birds' nests: and other Academy stuff, enough to
      frighten the daughter of an R. A. She determined to look through it one
      day, and clear it all. And the grotesque furniture interested her.</p>
      <p>Wrapped up carefully to preserve it from damage and dry-rot was the old
      family cradle, of rosewood. She had to unwrap it, to look at it. It had a
      certain charm: she looked at it a longtime.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's thousand pities it won't be called for,&quot; sighed Mrs.
      Bolton, who was helping. &quot;Though cradles like that are out of date
      nowadays.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;It might be called for. I might have a child,&quot; said Connie
      casually, as if saying she might have a new hat.</p>
      <p>&quot;You mean if anything happened to Sir Clifford!&quot; stammered
      Mrs. Bolton.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! I mean as things are. It's only muscular paralysis with Sir
      Clifford---it doesn't affect <i>him</i>,&quot; said Connie, lying as
      naturally as breathing.</p>
      <p>Clifford had put the idea into her head. He had said: &quot;Of course I
      may have a child yet. I'm not really mutilated at all. The potency may
      easily come back, even if the muscles of the hips and legs are paralysed.
      And then the seed may be transferred.&quot;</p>
      <p>He really felt, when he had his periods of energy and worked so hard at
      the question of the mines, as if his sexual potency were returning. Connie
      had looked at him in terror. But she was quite quick-witted enough to use
      his suggestion for her own preservation. For she would have a child if she
      could: but not his.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton was for a moment breathless, flabbergasted. Then she didn't
      believe it: she saw in it a ruse. Yet doctors could do such things
      nowadays. They might sort of graft seed.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, my Lady, I only hope and pray you may. It would be lovely
      for you: and for everybody. My word, a child in Wragby, what a difference
      it would make!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Wouldn't it!&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>And she chose three R. A. pictures of sixty years ago, to send to the
      Duchess of Shortlands for that lady's next charitable bazaar. She was
      called `the bazaar duchess', and she always asked all the county to send
      things for her to sell. She would be delighted with three framed R. A.'s.
      She might even call, on the strength of them. How furious Clifford was
      when she called!</p>
      <p>But oh my dear! Mrs. Bolton was thinking to herself. Is it Oliver
      Mellors' child you're preparing us for? Oh my dear, that <i>would</i> be a
      Tevershall baby in the Wragby cradle, my word! Wouldn't shame it, neither!</p>
      <p>Among other monstrosities in this lumber room was a largish black
      japanned box, excellently and ingeniously made some sixty or seventy years
      ago, and fitted with every imaginable object. On top was a concentrated
      toilet set: brushes, bottles, mirrors, combs, boxes, even three beautiful
      little razors in safety sheaths, shaving-bowl and all. Underneath came a
      sort of <i>escritoire</i> outfit: blotters, pens, ink-bottles, paper,
      envelopes, memorandum books: and then a perfect sewing-outfit, with three
      different sized scissors, thimbles, needles, silks and cottons, darning
      egg, all of the very best quality and perfectly finished. Then there was a
      little medicine store, with bottles labelled Laudanum, Tincture of Myrrh,
      Ess. Cloves and so on: but empty. Everything was perfectly new, and the
      whole thing, when shut up, was as big as a small, but fat weekend bag. And
      inside, it fitted together like a puzzle. The bottles could not possibly
      have spilled: there wasn't room.</p>
      <p>The thing was wonderfully made and contrived, excellent craftsmanship
      of the Victorian order. But somehow it was monstrous. Some Chatterley must
      even have felt it, for the thing had never been used. It had a peculiar
      soullessness.</p>
      <p>Yet Mrs. Bolton was thrilled.</p>
      <p>&quot;Look what beautiful brushes, so expensive, even the shaving
      brushes, three perfect ones! No! and those scissors! They're the best that
      money could buy. Oh, I call it lovely!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you?&quot; said Connie. &quot;Then you have it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh no, my Lady!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Of course! It will only lie here till Doomsday. If you won't have
      it, I'll send it to the Duchess as well as the pictures, and she doesn't
      deserve so much. Do have it!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, your Ladyship! Why, I shall never be able to thank you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You needn't try,&quot; laughed Connie.</p>
      <p>And Mrs. Bolton sailed down with the huge and very black box in her
      arms, flushing bright pink in her excitement.</p>
      <p>Mr. Betts drove her in the trap to her house in the village, with the
      box. And she <i>had</i> to have a few friends in, to show it: the
      school-mistress, the chemist's wife, Mrs. Weedon the under-cashier's wife.
      They thought it marvellous. And then started the whisper of Lady
      Chatterley's child.</p>
      <p>&quot;Wonders'll never cease!&quot; said Mrs. Weedon.</p>
      <p>But Mrs. Bolton was <i>convinced</i>, if it did come, it would be Sir
      Clifford's child. So there!</p>
      <p>Not long after, the rector said gently to Clifford:</p>
      <p>&quot;And may we really hope for an heir to Wragby? Ah, that would be
      the hand of God in mercy, indeed!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well! We may <i>hope</i>,&quot; said Clifford, with a faint
      irony, and at the same time, a certain conviction. He had begun to believe
      it really possible it might even be <i>his</i> child.</p>
      <p>Then one afternoon came Leslie Winter, Squire Winter, as everybody
      called him: lean, immaculate, and seventy: and every inch a gentleman, as
      Mrs. Bolton said to Mrs. Betts. Every millimetre indeed! And with his
      old-fashioned, rather haw-haw! manner of speaking, he seemed more out of
      date than bag wigs. Time, in her flight, drops these fine old feathers.</p>
      <p>They discussed the collieries. Clifford's idea was, that his coal, even
      the poor sort, could be made into hard concentrated fuel that would burn
      at great heat if fed with certain damp, acidulated air at a fairly strong
      pressure. It had long been observed that in a particularly strong, wet
      wind the pit-bank burned very vivid, gave off hardly any fumes, and left a
      fine powder of ash, instead of the slow pink gravel.</p>
