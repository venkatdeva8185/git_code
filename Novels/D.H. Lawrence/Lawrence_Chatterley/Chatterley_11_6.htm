Incarnate ugliness, and yet alive! What would become of them all?
      Perhaps with the passing of the coal they would disappear again, off the
      face of the earth. They had appeared out of nowhere in their thousands,
      when the coal had called for them. Perhaps they were only weird fauna of
      the coal-seams. Creatures of another reality, they were elementals,
      serving the elements of coal, as the metal-workers were elementals,
      serving the element of iron. Men not men, but animas of coal and iron and
      clay. Fauna of the elements, carbon, iron, silicon: elementals. They had
      perhaps some of the weird, inhuman beauty of minerals, the lustre of coal,
      the weight and blueness and resistance of iron, the transparency of glass.
      Elemental creatures, weird and distorted, of the mineral world! They
      belonged to the coal, the iron, the clay, as fish belong to the sea and
      worms to dead wood. The anima of mineral disintegration!</p>
      <p>Connie was glad to be home, to bury her head in the sand. She was glad
      even to babble to Clifford. For her fear of the mining and iron Midlands
      affected her with a queer feeling that went all over her, like influenza.</p>
      <p>&quot;Of course I had to have tea in Miss Bentley's shop,&quot; she
      said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Really! Winter would have given you tea.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh yes, but I daren't disappoint Miss Bentley.&quot;</p>
      <p>Miss Bentley was a shallow old maid with a rather large nose and
      romantic disposition who served tea with a careful intensity worthy of a
      sacrament.</p>
      <p>&quot;Did she ask after me?&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Of course!---. <i>May</i> I ask your Ladyship how Sir Clifford
      is!---I believe she ranks you even higher than Nurse Cavell!'&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And I suppose you said I was blooming.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! And she looked as rapt as if I had said the heavens had
      opened to you. I said if she ever came to Tevershall she was to come to
      see you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Me! Whatever for! See me!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why yes, Clifford. You can't be so adored without making some
      slight return. Saint George of Cappadocia was nothing to you, in her
      eyes.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And do you think she'll come?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, she blushed! and looked quite beautiful for a moment, poor
      thing! Why don't men marry the women who would really adore them?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The women start adoring too late. But did she say she'd
      come?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh!&quot; Connie imitated the breathless Miss Bentley, &quot;your
      Ladyship, if ever I should dare to presume!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Dare to presume! how absurd! But I hope to God she won't turn up.
      And how was her tea?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, Lipton's and <i>very</i> strong. But Clifford, do you realize
      you are the <i>Roman de la rose</i> of Miss Bentley and lots like
      her?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm not flattered, even then.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;They treasure up every one of your pictures in the illustrated
      papers, and probably pray for you every night. It's rather
      wonderful.&quot;</p>
      <p>She went upstairs to change.</p>
      <p>That evening he said to her:</p>
      <p>&quot;You do think, don't you, that there is something eternal in
      marriage?&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked at him.</p>
      <p>&quot;But Clifford, you make eternity sound like a lid or a long, long
      chain that trailed after one, no matter how far one went.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her, annoyed.</p>
      <p>&quot;What I mean,&quot; he said, &quot;is that if you go to Venice,
      you won't go in the hopes of some love affair that you can take <i>au
      grand sérieux</i>, will you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;A love affair in Venice <i>au grand sérieux</i>? No. I assure
      you! No, I'd never take a love affair in Venice more than <i>au très
      petit sérieux</i>.&quot;</p>
      <p>She spoke with a queer kind of contempt. He knitted his brows, looking
      at her.</p>
      <p>Coming downstairs in the morning, she found the keeper's dog Flossie
      sitting in the corridor outside Clifford's room, and whimpering very
      faintly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, Flossie!&quot; she said softly. &quot;What are you doing
      here?&quot;</p>
      <p>And she quietly opened Clifford's door. Clifford was sitting up in bed,
      with the bed-table and typewriter pushed aside, and the keeper was
      standing at attention at the foot of the bed. Flossie ran in. With a faint
      gesture of head and eyes, Mellors ordered her to the door again, and she
      slunk out.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, good morning, Clifford!&quot; Connie said. &quot;I didn't
      know you were busy.&quot; Then she looked at the keeper, saying good
      morning to him. He murmured his reply, looking at her as if vaguely. But
      she felt a whiff of passion touch her, from his mere presence.</p>
      <p>&quot;Did I interrupt you, Clifford? I'm sorry.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, it's nothing of any importance.&quot;</p>
      <p>She slipped out of the room again, and up to the blue boudoir on the
      first floor. She sat in the window, and saw him go down the drive, with
      his curious, silent motion, effaced. He had a natural sort of quiet
      distinction, an aloof pride, and also a certain look of frailty. A
      hireling! One of Clifford's hirelings! &quot;The fault, dear Brutus, is
      not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.&quot;</p>
      <p>Was he an underling? Was he? What did he think of <i>her</i>?</p>
      <p>It was a sunny day, and Connie was working in the garden, and Mrs.
      Bolton was helping her. For some reason, the two women had drawn together,
      in one of the unaccountable flows and ebbs of sympathy that exist between
      people. They were pegging down carnations, and putting in small plants for
      the summer. It was work they both liked. Connie especially felt a delight
      in putting the soft roots of young plants into a soft black puddle, and
      cradling them down. On this spring morning she felt a quiver in her womb
      too, as if the sunshine had touched it and made it happy.</p>
      <p>&quot;It is many years since you lost your husband?&quot; she said to
      Mrs. Bolton as she took up another little plant and laid it in its hole.</p>
      <p>&quot;Twenty-three!&quot; said Mrs. Bolton, as she carefully separated
      the young columbines into single plants. &quot;Twenty-three years since
      they brought him home.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie's heart gave a lurch, at the terrible finality of it.
      &quot;Brought him home!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why did he get killed, do you think?&quot; she asked. &quot;He
      was happy with you?&quot;</p>
