 <p>Connie was moving away . . . &quot;Well, thank you ever so much, Lady
      Chat'ley, I'm sure. Say thank you to Lady Chat'ley!&quot;--this last to
      the child.</p>
      <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; piped the child.</p>
      <p>&quot;There's a dear!&quot; laughed Connie, and she moved away, saying
      &quot;Good morning&quot;, heartily relieved to get away from the contact.&nbsp;
      Curious, she thought, that that thin, proud man should have that little,
      sharp woman for a mother!</p>
      <p>And the old woman, as soon as Connie had gone, rushed to the bit of
      mirror in the scullery, and looked at her face. Seeing it, she stamped her
      foot with impatience. &quot;Of <i>course</i> she had to catch me in my
      coarse apron, and a dirty face! Nice idea she'd get of me!&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie went slowly home to Wragby. &quot;Home!&quot;. . .it was a warm
      word to use for that great, weary warren. But then it was a word that had
      had its day. It was somehow cancelled. All the great words, it seemed to
      Connie, were cancelled for her generation: love, joy, happiness, home,
      mother, father, husband, all these great, dynamic words were half dead
      now, and dying from day to day. Home was a place you lived in, love was a
      thing you didn't fool yourself about, joy was a word you applied to a good
      Charleston, happiness was a term of hypocrisy used to bluff other people,
      a father was an individual who enjoyed his own existence, a husband was a
      man you lived with and kept going in spirits. As for sex, the last of the
      great words, it was just a cocktail term for an excitement that bucked you
      up for a while, then left you more raggy than ever. Frayed! It was as if
      the very material you were made of was cheap stuff, and was fraying out to
      nothing.</p>
      <p>All that really remained was a stubborn stoicism: and in that there was
      a certain pleasure. In the very experience of the nothingness of life,
      phase after phase, <i>étape</i> after <i>étape</i>, there was a certain
      grisly satisfaction. So that's <i>that</i>! Always this was the last
      utterance: home, love, marriage, Michaelis: So that's <i>that</i>! And
      when one died, the last words to life would be: So that's <i>that</i>!</p>
      <p>Money? Perhaps one couldn't say the same there. Money one always
      wanted. Money, Success, the bitch-goddess, as Tommy Dukes persisted in
      calling it, after Henry James, that was a permanent necessity. You
      couldn't spend your last sou, and say finally: So that's <i>that</i>! No,
      if you lived even another ten minutes, you wanted a few more sous for
      something or other. Just to keep the business mechanically going, you
      needed money. You had to have it. Money you <i>have</i> to have. You
      needn't really have anything else. So that's that!</p>
      <p>Since, of course, it's not your own fault you are alive. Once you are
      alive, money is a necessity, and the only absolute necessity. All the rest
      you can get along without, at a pinch. But not money. Emphatically, that's
      <i>that</i>!</p>
      <p>She thought of Michaelis, and the money she might have had with him;
      and even that she didn't want. She preferred the lesser amount which she
      helped Clifford to make by his writing. That she actually helped to
      make.--&quot;Clifford and I together, we make twelve hundred a year out of
      writing&quot;; so she put it to herself. Make money! Make it! Out of
      nowhere. Wring it out of the thin air! The last feat to be humanly proud
      of! The rest all-my-eye-Betty-Martin.</p>
      <p>So she plodded home to Clifford, to join forces with him again, to make
      another story out of nothingness: and a story meant money. Clifford seemed
      to care very much whether his stories were considered first-class
      literature or not. Strictly, she didn't care. Nothing in it! said her
      father. Twelve hundred pounds last year! was the retort simple and final.</p>
      <p>If you were young, you just set your teeth, and bit on and held on,
      till the money began to flow from the invisible; it was a question of
      power. It was a question of will; a subtle, subtle, powerful emanation of
      will out of yourself brought back to you the mysterious nothingness of
      money a word on a bit of paper. It was a sort of magic, certainly it was
      triumph. The bitch-goddess! Well, if one had to prostitute oneself, let it
      be to a bitch-goddess! One could always despise her even while one
      prostituted oneself to her, which was good.</p>
      <p>Clifford, of course, had still many childish taboos and fetishes. He
      wanted to be thought &quot;really good&quot;, which was all cock-a-hoopy
      nonsense. What was really good was what actually caught on. It was no good
      being really good and getting left with it. It seemed as if most of the
      `really good' men just missed the bus. After all you only lived one life,
      and if you missed the bus, you were just left on the pavement, along with
      the rest of the failures.</p>
      <p>Connie was contemplating a winter in London with Clifford, next winter.
      He and she had caught the bus all right, so they might as well ride on top
      for a bit, and show it.</p>
      <p>The worst of it was, Clifford tended to become vague, absent, and to
      fall into fits of vacant depression. It was the wound to his psyche coming
      out. But it made Connie want to scream. Oh God, if the mechanism of the
      consciousness itself was going to go wrong, then what was one to do? Hang
      it all, one did one's bit! Was one to be let down <i>absolutely</i>?</p>
      <p>Sometimes she wept bitterly, but even as she wept she was saying to
      herself: Silly fool, wetting hankies! As if that would get you anywhere!</p>
      <p>Since Michaelis, she had made up her mind she wanted nothing. That
      seemed the simplest solution of the otherwise insoluble. She wanted
      nothing more than what she'd got; only she wanted to get ahead with what
      she'd got: Clifford, the stories, Wragby, the Lady-Chatterley business,
      money and fame, such as it was. . .she wanted to go ahead with it all.
      Love, sex, all that sort of stuff, just water-ices! Lick it up and forget
      it. If you don't hang on to it in your mind, it's nothing. Sex especially.
      . .nothing! Make up your mind to it, and you've solved the problem. Sex
      and a cocktail: they both lasted about as long, had the same effect, and
      amounted to about the same thing.</p>
