 <p>&quot;But could you have made money except by plays?&quot; asked
      Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, probably not! I may be a good writer or I may be a bad one,
      but a writer and a writer of plays is what I am, and I've got to be.
      There's no question of that.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And you think it's a writer of popular plays that you've got to
      be?&quot; asked Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;There, exactly!&quot; he said, turning to her in a sudden flash.
      &quot;There's nothing in it! There's nothing in popularity. There's
      nothing in the public, if it comes to that. There's nothing really in my
      plays to <i>make</i> them popular. It's not that. They just are like the
      weather. . .the sort that will <i>have</i> to be. . .for the time
      being.&quot;</p>
      <p>He turned his slow, rather full eyes, that had been drowned in such
      fathomless disillusion, on Connie, and she trembled a little. He seemed so
      old. . .endlessly old, built up of layers of disillusion, going down in
      him generation after generation, like geological strata; and at the same
      time he was forlorn like a child. An outcast, in a certain sense; but with
      the desperate bravery of his rat-like existence.</p>
      <p>&quot;At least it's wonderful what you've done at your time of
      life,&quot; said Clifford contemplatively.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm thirty. . .yes, I'm thirty!&quot; said Michaelis, sharply and
      suddenly, with a curious laugh; hollow, triumphant, and bitter.</p>
      <p>&quot;And are you alone?&quot; asked Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;How do you mean? Do I live alone? I've got my servant. He's a
      Greek, so he says, and quite incompetent. But I keep him. And I'm going to
      marry. Oh, yes, I must marry.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;It sounds like going to have your tonsils cut,&quot; laughed
      Connie. &quot;Will it be an effort?&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her admiringly. &quot;Well, Lady Chatterley, somehow it
      will! I find. . . excuse me. . . I find I can't marry an Englishwoman, not
      even an Irishwoman. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Try an American,&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, American!&quot; He laughed a hollow laugh. &quot;No, I've
      asked my man if he will find me a Turk or something. . .something nearer
      to the Oriental.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie really wondered at this queer, melancholy specimen of
      extraordinary success; it was said he had an income of fifty thousand
      dollars from America alone. Sometimes he was handsome: sometimes as he
      looked sideways, downwards, and the light fell on him, he had the silent,
      enduring beauty of a carved ivory Negro mask, with his rather full eyes,
      and the strong queerly-arched brows, the immobile, compressed mouth; that
      momentary but revealed immobility, an immobility, a timelessness which the
      Buddha aims at, and which Negroes express sometimes without ever aiming at
      it; something old, old, and acquiescent in the race! Aeons of acquiescence
      in race destiny, instead of our individual resistance. And then a swimming
      through, like rats in a dark river. Connie felt a sudden, strange leap of
      sympathy for him, a leap mingled with compassion, and tinged with
      repulsion, amounting almost to love. The outsider! The outsider! And they
      called him a bounder! How much more bounderish and assertive Clifford
      looked! How much stupider!</p>
      <p>Michaelis knew at once he had made an impression on her. He turned his
      full, hazel, slightly prominent eyes on her in a look of pure detachment.
      He was estimating her, and the extent of the impression he had made. With
      the English nothing could save him from being the eternal outsider, not
      even love. Yet women sometimes fell for him. . .Englishwomen too.</p>
      <p>He knew just where he was with Clifford. They were two alien dogs which
      would have liked to snarl at one another, but which smiled instead,
      perforce. But with the woman he was not quite so sure.</p>
      <p>Breakfast was served in the bedrooms; Clifford never appeared before
      lunch, and the dining-room was a little dreary. After coffee Michaelis,
      restless and ill-sitting soul, wondered what he should do. It was a fine
      November. . .day fine for Wragby. He looked over the melancholy park. My
      God! What a place!</p>
      <p>He sent a servant to ask, could he be of any service to Lady
      Chatterley: he thought of driving into Sheffield. The answer came, would
      he care to go up to Lady Chatterley's sitting-room.</p>
      <p>Connie had a sitting-room on the third floor, the top floor of the
      central portion of the house. Clifford's rooms were on the ground floor,
      of course. Michaelis was flattered by being asked up to Lady Chatterley's
      own parlour. He followed blindly after the servant. . .he never noticed
      things, or had contact with his surroundings. In her room he did glance
      vaguely round at the fine German reproductions of Renoir and Cézanne.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's very pleasant up here,&quot; he said, with his queer smile,
      as if it hurt him to smile, showing his teeth. &quot;You are wise to get
      up to the top.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>Her room was the only gay, modern one in the house, the only spot in
      Wragby where her personality was at all revealed. Clifford had never seen
      it, and she asked very few people up.</p>
      <p>Now she and Michaelis sat on opposite sides of the fire and talked. She
      asked him about himself, his mother and father, his brothers. . .other
      people were always something of a wonder to her, and when her sympathy was
      awakened she was quite devoid of class feeling. Michaelis talked frankly
      about himself, quite frankly, without affectation, simply revealing his
      bitter, indifferent, stray-dog's soul, then showing a gleam of revengeful
      pride in his success.</p>
      <p>&quot;But why are you such a lonely bird?&quot; Connie asked him; and
      again he looked at her, with his full, searching, hazel look.</p>
      <p>&quot;Some birds <i>are</i> that way,&quot; he replied. Then, with a
      touch of familiar irony: &quot;but, look here, what about yourself? Aren't
      you by way of being a lonely bird yourself?&quot; Connie, a little
      startled, thought about it for a few moments, and then she said:
      &quot;Only in a way! Not altogether, like you!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Am I altogether a lonely bird?&quot; he asked, with his queer
      grin of a smile, as if he had toothache; it was so wry, and his eyes were
      so perfectly unchangingly melancholy, or stoical, or disillusioned or
      afraid.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why?&quot; she said, a little breathless, as she looked at him.
      &quot;You are, aren't you?&quot;</p>
      <p>She felt a terrible appeal coming to her from him, that made her almost
      lose her balance.</p>
