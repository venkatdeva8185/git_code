 <p>&quot;Say you'll always love me!&quot; she pleaded.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; he said, abstractedly. And she felt her questions
      driving him away from her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Mustn't we get up?&quot; he said at last.</p>
      <p>&quot;No!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>But she could feel his consciousness straying, listening to the noises
      outside.</p>
      <p>&quot;It'll be nearly dark,&quot; he said. And she heard the pressure
      of circumstances in his voice. She kissed him, with a woman's grief at
      yielding up her hour.</p>
      <p>He rose, and turned up the lantern, then began to pull on his clothes,
      quickly disappearing inside them. Then he stood there, above her,
      fastening his breeches and looking down at her with dark, wide-eyes, his
      face a little flushed and his hair ruffled, curiously warm and still and
      beautiful in the dim light of the lantern, so beautiful, she would never
      tell him how beautiful. It made her want to cling fast to him, to hold
      him, for there was a warm, half-sleepy remoteness in his beauty that made
      her want to cry out and clutch him, to have him. She would never have him.
      So she lay on the blanket with curved, soft naked haunches, and he had no
      idea what she was thinking, but to him too she was beautiful, the soft,
      marvellous thing he could go into, beyond everything.</p>
      <p>&quot;I love thee that I call go into thee,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you like me?&quot; she said, her heart beating.</p>
      <p>&quot;It heals it all up, that I can go into thee. I love thee that tha
      opened to me. I love thee that I came into thee like that.&quot;</p>
      <p>He bent down and kissed her soft flank, rubbed his cheek against it,
      then covered it up.</p>
      <p>&quot;And will you never leave me?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Dunna ask them things,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you do believe I love you?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Tha loved me just now, wider than iver tha thout tha would. But
      who knows what'll 'appen, once tha starts thinkin' about it!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, don't say those things!---And you don't really think that I
      wanted to make use of you, do you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;How?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;To have a child---?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Now anybody can 'ave any childt i' th' world,&quot; he said, as
      he sat down fastening on his leggings.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah no!&quot; she cried. &quot;You don't mean it?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Eh well!&quot; he said, looking at her under his brows.
      &quot;This wor t' best.&quot;</p>
      <p>She lay still. He softly opened the door. The sky was dark blue, with
      crystalline, turquoise rim. He went out, to shut up the hens, speaking
      softly to his dog. And she lay and wondered at the wonder of life, and of
      being.</p>
      <p>When he came back she was still lying there, glowing like a gipsy. He
      sat on the stool by her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Tha mun come one naight ter th' cottage, afore tha goes; sholl
      ter?&quot; he asked, lifting his eyebrows as he looked at her, his hands
      dangling between his knees.</p>
      <p>&quot;Sholl ter?&quot; she echoed, teasing.</p>
      <p>He smiled. &quot;Ay, sholl ter?'&quot; he repeated.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; she said, imitating the dialect sound.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yi!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yi!&quot; she repeated.</p>
      <p>&quot;An&quot; slaip wi' me,' he said. `It needs that. When sholt
      come?'</p>
      <p>&quot;When sholl I?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay,&quot; he said, &quot;tha canna do't. When sholt come
      then?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;'Appen Sunday,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;'Appen a' Sunday! Ay!&quot;</p>
      <p>He laughed at her quickly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay, tha canna,'&quot; he protested.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why canna I?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>He laughed. Her attempts at the dialect were so ludicrous, somehow.</p>
      <p>&quot;Coom then, tha mun goo!&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Mun I?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Maun Ah!&quot; he corrected.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why should I say <i>maun</i> when you said <i>mun</i>?&quot; she
      protested. &quot;You're not playing fair.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Arena Ah!&quot; he said, leaning forward and softly stroking her
      face.</p>
      <p>&quot;Th'art good cunt, though, aren't ter? Best bit o' cunt left on
      earth. When ter likes! When tha'rt willin'!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What is cunt?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;An' doesn't ter know? Cunt! It's thee down theer; an' what I get
      when I'm i'side thee, and what tha gets when I'm i'side thee; it's a` as
      it is, all on't.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;All on't,'&quot;she teased. &quot;Cunt! It's like fuck
      then.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay nay! Fuck's only what you do. animals fuck. But cunt's a lot
      more than that. It's thee, dost see: an' tha'rt a lot besides an animal,
      aren't ter? --- even ter fuck? Cunt! Eh, that's the beauty o' thee,
      lass!&quot;</p>
      <p>She got up and kissed him between the eyes, that looked at her so dark
      and soft and unspeakably warm, so unbearably beautiful.</p>
      <p>&quot;Is it?&quot; she said. &quot;And do you care for me?&quot;</p>
      <p>He kissed her without answering.</p>
      <p>&quot;Tha mun goo, let me dust thee,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>His hand passed over the curves of her body, firmly, without desire,
      but with soft, intimate knowledge.</p>
      <p>As she ran home in the twilight the world seemed a dream; the trees in
      the park seemed bulging and surging at anchor on a tide, and the heave of
      the slope to the house was alive.</p>
