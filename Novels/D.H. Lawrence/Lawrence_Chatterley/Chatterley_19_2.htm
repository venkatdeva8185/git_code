 <p>After this, Clifford became like a child with Mrs. Bolton. He would
      hold her h, and rest his head on her breast, and when she once lightly
      kissed him, he said! &quot;Yes! Do kiss me! Do kiss me!&quot; And when she
      sponged his great blond body, he would say the same! &quot;Do kiss
      me!&quot; and she would lightly kiss his body, anywhere, half in mockery.</p>
      <p>And he lay with a queer, blank face like a child, with a bit of the
      wonderment of a child. And he would gaze on her with wide, childish eyes,
      in a relaxation of madonna-worship. It was sheer relaxation on his part,
      letting go all his manhood, and sinking back to a childish position that
      was really perverse. And then he would put his hand into her bosom and
      feel her breasts, and kiss them in exultation, the exultation of
      perversity, of being a child when he was a man.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton was both thrilled and ashamed, she both loved and hated it.
      Yet she never rebuffed nor rebuked him. And they drew into a closer
      physical intimacy, an intimacy of perversity, when he was a child stricken
      with an apparent candour and an apparent wonderment, that looked almost
      like a religious exaltation: the perverse and literal rendering of:
      &quot;except ye become again as a little child&quot;.---While she was the
      Magna Mater, full of power and potency, having the great blond child-man
      under her will and her stroke entirely.</p>
      <p>The curious thing was that when this child-man, which Clifford was now
      and which he had been becoming for years, emerged into the world, it was
      much sharper and keener than the real man he used to be. This perverted
      child-man was now a <i>real</i> business-man; when it was a question of
      affairs, he was an absolute he-man, sharp as a needle, and impervious as a
      bit of steel. When he was out among men, seeking his own ends, and
      &quot;making good&quot; his colliery workings, he had an almost uncanny
      shrewdness, hardness, and a straight sharp punch. It was as if his very
      passivity and prostitution to the Magna Mater gave him insight into
      material business affairs, and lent him a certain remarkable inhuman
      force. The wallowing in private emotion, the utter abasement of his manly
      self, seemed to lend him a second nature, cold, almost visionary,
      business-clever. In business he was quite inhuman.</p>
      <p>And in this Mrs. Bolton triumphed. &quot;How he's getting on!&quot; she
      would say to herself in pride. &quot;And that's my doing! My word, he'd
      never have got on like this with Lady Chatterley. She was not the one to
      put a man forward. She wanted too much for herself.&quot;</p>
      <p>At the same time, in some corner of her weird female soul, how she
      despised him and hated him! He was to her the fallen beast, the squirming
      monster. And while she aided and abetted him all she could, away in the
      remotest corner of her ancient healthy womanhood she despised him with a
      savage contempt that knew no bounds. The merest tramp was better than he.</p>
      <p>His behaviour with regard to Connie was curious. He insisted on seeing
      her again. He insisted, moreover, on her coming to Wragby. On this point
      he was finally and absolutely fixed. Connie had promised to come back to
      Wragby, faithfully.</p>
      <p>&quot;But is it any use?&quot; said Mrs. Bolton. &quot;Can't you let
      her go, and be rid of her?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! She said she was coming back, and she's got to come.&quot;</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton opposed him no more. She knew what she was dealing with.</p>
      <p>&quot;I needn't tell you what effect your letter has had on me,&quot;
      he wrote to Connie to London. &quot;Perhaps you can imagine it if you try,
      though no doubt you won't trouble to use your imagination on my behalf.</p>
      <p>I can only say one thing in answer: I must see you personally, here at
      Wragby, before I can do anything. You promised faithfully to come back to
      Wragby, and I hold you to the promise. I don't believe anything nor
      understand anything until I see you personally, here under normal
      circumstances. I needn't tell you that nobody here suspects anything, so
      your return would be quite normal. Then if you feel, after we have talked
      things over, that you still remain in the same mind, no doubt we can come
      to terms.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie showed this letter to Mellors.</p>
      <p>&quot;He wants to begin his revenge on you,&quot; he said, handing the
      letter back.</p>
      <p>Connie was silent. She was somewhat surprised to find that she was
      afraid of Clifford. She was afraid to go near him. She was afraid of him
      as if he were evil and dangerous.</p>
      <p>&quot;What shall I do?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nothing, if you don't want to do anything.&quot;</p>
      <p>She replied, trying to put Clifford off. He answered: &quot;If you
      don't come back to Wragby now, I shall consider that you are coming back
      one day, and act accordingly. I shall just go on the same, and wait for
      you here, if I wait for fifty years.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was frightened. This was bullying of an insidious sort. She had no
      doubt he meant what he said. He would not divorce her, and the child would
      be his, unless she could find some means of establishing its illegitimacy.</p>
      <p>After a time of worry and harassment, she decided to go to Wragby.
      Hilda would go with her. She wrote this to Clifford. He replied: &quot;I
      shall not welcome your sister, but I shall not deity her the door. I have
      no doubt she has connived at your desertion of your duties and
      responsibilities, so do not expect me to show pleasure in seeing
      her.&quot;</p>
      <p>They went to Wragby. Clifford was away when they arrived. Mrs. Bolton
      received them.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, your Ladyship, it isn't the happy home-coming we hoped for,
      is it!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Isn't it?&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>So this woman knew! How much did the rest of the servants know or
      suspect?</p>
      <p>She entered the house, which now she hated with every fibre in her
      body. The great, rambling mass of a place seemed evil to her, just a
      menace over her. She was no longer its mistress, she was its victim.</p>
      <p>&quot;I can't stay long here,&quot; she whispered to Hilda, terrified.</p>
      <p>And she suffered going into her own bedroom, re-entering into
      possession as if nothing had happened. She hated every minute inside the
      Wragby walls.</p>
      <p>They did not meet Clifford till they went down to dinner. He was
      dressed, and with a black tie: rather reserved, and very much the superior
      gentleman. He behaved perfectly politely during the meal and kept a polite
      sort of conversation going: but it seemed all touched with insanity.</p>
      <p>&quot;How much do the servants know?&quot; asked Connie, when the woman
      was out of the room.</p>
      <p>&quot;Of your intentions? Nothing whatsoever.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Mrs. Bolton knows.&quot;</p>
      <p>He changed colour.</p>
      <p>&quot;Mrs. Bolton is not exactly one of the servants,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I don't mind.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was tension till after coffee, when Hilda said she would go up to
      her room.</p>
      <p>Clifford and Connie sat in silence when she had gone. Neither would
      begin to speak. Connie was so glad that he wasn't taking the pathetic
      line, she kept him up to as much haughtiness as possible. She just sat
      silent and looked down at her hands.</p>
