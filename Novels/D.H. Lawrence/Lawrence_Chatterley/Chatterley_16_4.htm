 <p>&quot;You'll regret it,&quot; she said,</p>
      <p>&quot;I shan't,&quot; cried Connie, flushed red. &quot;He's quite the
      exception. I <i>really</i> love him. He's lovely as a lover.&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda still pondered.</p>
      <p>&quot;You'll get over him quite soon,&quot; she said, &quot;and live to
      be ashamed of yourself because of him.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I shan't! I hope I'm going to have a child of his.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;<i>Connie</i>!&quot; said Hilda, hard as a hammer-stroke, and
      pale with anger.</p>
      <p>&quot;I shall if I possibly can. I should be fearfully proud if I had a
      child by him.&quot;</p>
      <p>It was no use talking to her. Hilda pondered.</p>
      <p>&quot;And doesn't Clifford suspect?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh no! Why should he?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I've no doubt you've given him plenty of occasion for
      suspicion,&quot; said Hilda.</p>
      <p>&quot;Not at all.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And tonight's business seems quite gratuitous folly. Where does
      the man live?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;In the cottage at the other end of the wood.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Is he a bachelor?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! His wife left him.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;How old?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know. Older than me.&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda became more angry at every reply, angry as her mother used to be,
      in a kind of paroxysm. But still she hid it.</p>
      <p>&quot;I would give up tonight's escapade if I were you,&quot; she
      advised calmly.</p>
      <p>&quot;I can't! I <i>must</i> stay with him tonight, or I can't go to
      Venice at all. I just can't.&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda heard her father over again, and she gave way, out of mere
      diplomacy. And she consented to drive to Mansfield, both of them, to
      dinner, to bring Connie back to the lane-end after dark, and to fetch her
      from the lane-end the next morning, herself sleeping in Mansfield, only
      half an hour away, good going.&nbsp; But she was furious. She stored it up
      against her sister, this balk in her plans.</p>
      <p>Connie flung an emerald-green shawl over her window-sill.</p>
      <p>On the strength of her anger, Hilda warmed toward Clifford.&nbsp; After
      all, he had a mind. And if he had no sex, functionally, all the better: so
      much the less to quarrel about! Hilda wanted no more of that sex business,
      where men became nasty, selfish little horrors. Connie really had less to
      put up with than many women if she did but know it.</p>
      <p>And Clifford decided that Hilda, after all, was a decidedly intelligent
      woman, and would make a man a first-rate helpmate, if he were going in for
      politics for example. Yes, she had none of Connie's silliness, Connie was
      more a child: you had to make excuses for her, because she was not
      altogether dependable.</p>
      <p>There was an early cup of tea in the hall, where doors were open to let
      in the sun. Everybody seemed to be panting a little.</p>
      <p>&quot;Good-bye, Connie girl! Come back to me safely.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Good-bye, Clifford! Yes, I shan't be long.&quot; Connie was
      almost tender.</p>
      <p>&quot;Good-bye, Hilda! You will keep an eye on her, won't you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll even keep two!&quot; said Hilda. &quot;She shan't go very
      far astray.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;It's a promise!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Good-bye, Mrs. Bolton! I know you'll look after Sir Clifford
      nobly.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'll do what I can, your Ladyship.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And write to me if there is any news, and tell me about Sir
      Clifford, how he is.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Very good, your Ladyship, I will. And have a good time, and come
      back and cheer us up.&quot;</p>
      <p>Everybody waved. The car went off Connie looked back and saw Clifford,
      sitting at the top of the steps in his house-chair. After all, he was her
      husband: Wragby was her home: circumstance had done it.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Chambers held the gate and wished her ladyship a happy holiday.
      The car slipped out of the dark spinney that masked the park, on to the
      highroad where the colliers were trailing home. Hilda turned to the
      Crosshill Road, that was not a main road, but ran to Mansfield. Connie put
      on goggles. They ran beside the railway, which was in a cutting below
      them. Then they crossed the cutting on a bridge.</p>
      <p>&quot;That's the lane to the cottage!&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>Hilda glanced at it impatiently.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's a frightful pity we can't go straight off!' she said. We
      could have been in Pall Mall by nine o'clock.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm sorry for your sake,&quot; said Connie, from behind her
      goggles.</p>
      <p>They were soon at Mansfield, that once-romantic, now utterly
      disheartening colliery town. Hilda stopped at the hotel named in the
      motor-car book, and took a room. The whole thing was utterly
      uninteresting, and she was almost too angry to talk. However, Connie <i>had</i>
      to tell her something of the man's history.</p>
      <p>&quot;<i>He</i>! <i>He</i>! What name do you call him by? You only say <i>he</i>,&quot;
      said Hilda.</p>
      <p>&quot;I've never called him by any name: nor he me: which is curious,
      when you come to think of it. Unless we say Lady Jane and John Thomas. But
      his name is Oliver Mellors.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And how would you like to be Mrs. Oliver Mellors, instead of Lady
      Chatterley?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'd love it.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was nothing to be done with Connie. And anyhow, if the man had
      been a lieutenant in the army in India for four or five years, he must be
      more or less presentable. Apparently he had character. Hilda began to
      relent a little.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you'll be through with him in awhile,&quot; she said,
      &quot;and then you'll be ashamed of having been connected with him. One <i>can't</i>
      mix up with the working people.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you are such a socialist! you're always on the side of the
      working classes.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I may be on their side in a political crisis, but being on their
      side makes me know how impossible it is to mix one's life with theirs. Not
      out of snobbery, but just because the whole rhythm is different.&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda had lived among the real political intellectuals, so she was
      disastrously unanswerable.</p>
      <p>The nondescript evening in the hotel dragged out, and at last they had
      a nondescript dinner. Then Connie slipped a few things into a little silk
      bag, and combed her hair once more.</p>
      <p>&quot;After all, Hilda,&quot; she said, &quot;love can be wonderful:
      when you feel you <i>live</i>, and are in the very middle of
      creation.&quot; It was almost like bragging on her part.</p>
      <p>&quot;I suppose every mosquito feels the same,&quot; said Hilda.
      &quot;Do you think it does? How nice for it!'</p>
      <p>The evening was wonderfully clear and long-lingering, even in the small
      town. It would be half-light all night. With a face like a mask, from
      resentment, Hilda started her car again, and the two sped back on their
      traces, taking the other road, through Bolsover.</p>
