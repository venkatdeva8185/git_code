&quot;Then came Bertha Coutts. They'd lived next door to us when I was
      a little lad, so I knew 'em all right. And they were common. Well, Bertha
      went away to some place or other in Birmingham; she said, as a lady's
      companion; everybody else said, as a waitress or something in a hotel.
      Anyhow just when I was more than fed up with that other girl, when I was
      twenty-one, back comes Bertha, with airs and graces and smart clothes and
      a sort of bloom on her: a sort of sensual bloom that you'd see sometimes
      on a woman, or on a trolly. Well, I was in a state of murder. I chucked up
      my job at Butterley because I thought I was a weed, clerking there: and I
      got on as overhead blacksmith at Tevershall: shoeing horses mostly. It had
      been my dad's job, and I'd always been with him. It was a job I liked:
      handling horses: and it came natural to me. So I stopped talking ``fine'',
      as they call it, talking proper English, and went back to talking broad. I
      still read books, at home: but I blacksmithed and had a pony-trap of my
      own, and was My Lord Duckfoot. My dad left me three hundred pounds when he
      died. So I took on with Bertha, and I was glad she was common. I wanted
      her to be common. I wanted to be common myself. Well, I married her, and
      she wasn't bad. Those other ``pure'' women had nearly taken all the balls
      out of me, but she was all right that way. She wanted me, and made no
      bones about it. And I was as pleased as punch. That was what I wanted: a
      woman who <i>wanted</i> me to fuck her. So I fucked her like a good un.
      And I think she despised me a bit, for being so pleased about it, and
      bringin' her her breakfast in bed sometimes. She sort of let things go,
      didn't get me a proper dinner when I came home from work, and if I said
      anything, flew out at me. And I flew back, hammer and tongs. She flung a
      cup at me and I took her by the scruff of the neck and squeezed the life
      out of her. That sort of thing! But she treated me with insolence. And she
      got so's she'd never have me when I wanted her: never. Always put me off,
      brutal as you like. And then when she'd put me right off, and I didn't
      want her, she'd come all lovey-dovey, and get me. And I always went. But
      when I had her, she'd never come off when I did. Never! She'd just wait.
      If I kept back for half an hour, she'd keep back longer. And when I'd come
      and really finished, then she'd start on her own account, and I had to
      stop inside her till she brought herself off, wriggling and shouting,
      she'd clutch clutch with herself down there, an' then she'd come off, fair
      in ecstasy. And then she'd say: That was lovely! Gradually I got sick of
      it: and she got worse. She sort of got harder and harder to bring off, and
      she'd sort of tear at me down there, as if it was a beak tearing at me. By
      God, you think a woman's soft down there, like a fig. But I tell you the
      old rampers have beaks between their legs, and they tear at you with it
      till you're sick. Self! Self! Self! all self! tearing and shouting! They
      talk about men's selfishness, but I doubt if it can ever touch a woman's
      blind beakishness, once she's gone that way. Like an old trull! And she
      couldn't help it. I told her about it, I told her how I hated it. And
      she'd even try. She'd try to lie still and let <i>me</i> work the
      business. She'd try. But it was no good. She got no feeling off it, from
      my working. She had to work the thing herself, grind her own coffee. And
      it came back on her like a raving necessity, she had to let herself go,
      and tear, tear, tear, as if she had no sensation in her except in the top
      of her beak, the very outside top tip, that rubbed and tore. That's how
      old whores used to be, so men used to say. It was a low kind of self-will
      in her, a raving sort of self-will: like in a woman who drinks. Well in
      the end I couldn't stand it. We slept apart. She herself had started it,
      in her bouts when she wanted to be clear of me, when she said I bossed
      her. She had started having a room for herself. But the time came when I
      wouldn't have her coming to my room. I wouldn't.</p>
      <p>&quot;I hated it. And she hated me. My God, how she hated me before
      that child was born! I often think she conceived it out of hate. Anyhow,
      after the child was born I left her alone. And then came the war, and I
      joined up. And I didn't come back till I knew she was with that fellow at
      Stacks Gate.&quot;</p>
      <p>He broke off, pale in the face.</p>
      <p>&quot;And what is the man at Stacks Gate like?&quot; asked Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;A big baby sort of fellow, very low-mouthed. She bullies him, and
      they both drink.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;My word, if she came back!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;My God, yes! I should just go, disappear again.&quot;</p>
      <p>There was a silence. The pasteboard in the fire had turned to grey ash.</p>
      <p>&quot;So when you did get a woman who wanted you,&quot; said Connie,
      &quot;you got a bit too much of a good thing.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! Seems so! Yet even then I'd rather have her than the
      never-never ones: the white love of my youth, and that other
      poison-smelling lily, and the rest.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What about the rest?&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;The rest? There is no rest. Only to my experience the mass of
      women are like this: most of them want a man, but don't want the sex, but
      they put up with it, as part of the bargain. The more old-fashioned sort
      just lie there like nothing and let you go ahead. They don't mind
      afterwards: then they like you. But the actual thing itself is nothing to
      them, a bit distasteful. Add most men like it that way. I hate it. But the
      sly sort of women who are like that pretend they're not. They pretend
      they're passionate and have thrills. But it's all cockaloopy. They make it
      up. Then there's the ones that love everything, every kind of feeling and
      cuddling and going off, every kind except the natural one. They always
      make you go off when you're <i>not </i>in the only place you should be,
      when you go off.---Then there's the hard sort, that are the devil to bring
      off at all, and bring themselves off, like my wife. They want to be the
      active party.---Then there's the sort that's just dead inside: but dead:
      and they know it. Then there's the sort that puts you out before you
      really 'come', and go on writhing their loins till they bring themselves
      off against your thighs. But they're mostly the Lesbian sort. It's
      astonishing how Lesbian women are, consciously or unconsciously. Seems to
      me they're nearly all Lesbian.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And do you mind?&quot; asked Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;I could kill them. When I'm with a woman who's really Lesbian, I
      fairly howl in my soul, wanting to kill her.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And what do you do?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Just go away as fast as I can.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But do you think Lesbian women any worse than homosexual
      men?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot; <i>I</i> do! Because I've suffered more from them. In the
      abstract, I've no idea. When I get with a Lesbian woman, whether she knows
      she's one or not, I see red. No, no! But I wanted to have nothing to do
      with any woman any more. I wanted to keep to myself: keep my privacy and
      my decency.&quot;</p>
