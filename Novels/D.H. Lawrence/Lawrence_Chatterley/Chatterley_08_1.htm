 <p>Mrs. Bolton also kept a cherishing eye on Connie, feeling she must
      extend to her her female and professional protection. She was always
      urging her ladyship to walk out, to drive to Uthwaite, to be in the air.
      For Connie had got into the habit of sitting still by the fire, pretending
      to read; or to sew feebly, and hardly going out at all.</p>
      <p>It was a blowy day soon after Hilda had gone, that Mrs. Bolton said:
      &quot;Now why don't you go for a walk through the wood, and look at the
      daffs behind the keeper's cottage? They're the prettiest sight you'd see
      in a day's march. And you could put some in your room; wild daffs are
      always so cheerful-looking, aren't they?&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie took it in good part, even daffs for daffodils. Wild daffodils!
      After all, one could not stew in one's own juice. The spring came back. .
      .&quot;Seasons return, but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of
      Ev'n or Morn.&quot;</p>
      <p>And the keeper, his thin, white body, like a lonely pistil of an
      invisible flower! She had forgotten him in her unspeakable depression. But
      now something roused. . .&quot;Pale beyond porch and portal&quot;. . .the
      thing to do was to pass the porches and the portals.</p>
      <p>She was stronger, she could walk better, and in the wood the wind would
      not be so tiring as it was across the bark, flatten against her. She
      wanted to forget, to forget the world, and all the dreadful,
      carrion-bodied people. &quot;Ye must be born again! I believe in the
      resurrection of the body! Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and
      die, it shall by no means bring forth. When the crocus cometh forth I too
      will emerge and see the sun!&quot; In the wind of March endless phrases
      swept through her consciousness.</p>
      <p>Little gusts of sunshine blew, strangely bright, and lit up the
      celandines at the wood's edge, under the hazel-rods, they spangled out
      bright and yellow. And the wood was still, stiller, but yet gusty with
      crossing sun. The first windflowers were out, and all the wood seemed pale
      with the pallor of endless little anemones, sprinkling the shaken floor.
      &quot;The world has grown pale with thy breath.&quot; But it was the
      breath of Persephone, this time; she was out of hell on a cold morning.
      Cold breaths of wind came, and overhead there was an anger of entangled
      wind caught among the twigs. It, too, was caught and trying to tear itself
      free, the wind, like Absalom. How cold the anemones looked, bobbing their
      naked white shoulders over crinoline skirts of green. But they stood it. A
      few first bleached little primroses too, by the path, and yellow buds
      unfolding themselves.</p>
      <p>The roaring and swaying was overhead, only cold currents came down
      below. Connie was strangely excited in the wood, and the colour flew in
      her cheeks, and burned blue in her eyes. She walked ploddingly, picking a
      few primroses and the first violets, that smelled sweet and cold, sweet
      and cold. And she drifted on without knowing where she was.</p>
      <p>Till she came to the clearing, at the end of the wood, and saw the
      green-stained stone cottage, looking almost rosy, like the flesh
      underneath a mushroom, its stone warmed in a burst of sun. And there was a
      sparkle of yellow jasmine by the door; the closed door. But no sound; no
      smoke from the chimney; no dog barking.</p>
      <p>She went quietly round to the back, where the bank rose up; she had an
      excuse, to see the daffodils.</p>
      <p>And they were there, the short-stemmed flowers, rustling and fluttering
      and shivering, so bright and alive, but with nowhere to hide their faces,
      as they turned them away from the wind.</p>
      <p>They shook their bright, sunny little rags in bouts of distress. But
      perhaps they liked it really; perhaps they really liked the tossing.</p>
      <p>Constance sat down with her back to a young pine-tree, that swayed
      against her with curious life, elastic, and powerful, rising up. The
      erect, alive thing, with its top in the sun! And she watched the daffodils
      turn golden, in a burst of sun that was warm on her hands and lap. Even
      she caught the faint, tarry scent of the flowers. And then, being so still
      and alone, she seemed to bet into the current of her own proper destiny.
      She had been fastened by a rope, and jagging and snarring like a boat at
      its moorings; now she was loose and adrift.</p>
      <p>The sunshine gave way to chill; the daffodils were in shadow, dipping
      silently. So they would dip through the day and the long cold night. So
      strong in their frailty!</p>
      <p>She rose, a little stiff, took a few daffodils, and went down. She
      hated breaking the flowers, but she wanted just one or two to go with her.
      She would have to go back to Wragby and its walls, and now she hated it,
      especially its thick walls. Walls! Always walls! Yet one needed them in
      this wind.</p>
      <p>When she got home Clifford asked her:</p>
      <p>&quot;Where did you go?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Right across the wood! Look, aren't the little daffodils
      adorable? To think they should come out of the earth!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Just as much out of air and sunshine,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;But modelled in the earth,&quot; she retorted, with a prompt
      contradiction, that surprised her a little.</p>
      <p>The next afternoon she went to the wood again. She followed the broad
      riding that swerved round and up through the larches to a spring called
      John's Well. It was cold on this hillside, and not a flower in the
      darkness of larches. But the icy little spring softly pressed upwards from
      its tiny well-bed of pure, reddish-white pebbles. How icy and clear it
      was! Brilliant! The new keeper had no doubt put in fresh pebbles. She
      heard the faint tinkle of water, as the tiny overflow trickled over and
      downhill. Even above the hissing boom of the larchwood, that spread its
      bristling, leafless, wolfish darkness on the down-slope, she heard the
      tinkle as of tiny water-bells.</p>
