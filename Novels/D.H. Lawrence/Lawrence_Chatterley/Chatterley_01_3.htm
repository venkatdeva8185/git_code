 <p>Therefore the peculiar soft assurance of a girl like Constance Reid
fascinated him. She was so much more mistress of herself in that outer world of
chaos than he was master of himself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless he too was a rebel: rebelling even against his class. Or perhaps
rebel is too strong a word; far too strong. He was only caught in the general,
popular recoil of the young against convention and against any sort of real
authority. Fathers were ridiculous: his own obstinate one supremely so. And
governments were ridiculous: our own wait-and-see sort especially so. And armies
were ridiculous, and old buffers of generals altogether, the red-faced Kitchener
supremely. Even the war was ridiculous, though it did kill rather a lot of
people.</p>
<p>In fact everything was a little ridiculous, or very ridiculous: certainly
everything connected with authority, whether it were in the army or the
government or the universities, was ridiculous to a degree. And as far as the
governing class made any pretensions to govern, they were ridiculous too. Sir
Geoffrey, Clifford's father, was intensely ridiculous, chopping down his trees,
and weeding men out of his colliery to shove them into the war; and himself
being so safe and patriotic; but, also, spending more money on his country than
he'd got.</p>
<p>When Miss Chatterley--Emma--came down to London from the Midlands to do some
nursing work, she was very witty in a quiet way about Sir Geoffrey and his
determined patriotism. Herbert, the elder brother and heir, laughed outright,
though it was his trees that were falling for trench props. But Clifford only
smiled a little uneasily. Everything was ridiculous, quite true. But when it
came too close and oneself became ridiculous too...? At least people of a
different class, like Connie, were earnest about something. They believed in
something.</p>
<p>They were rather earnest about the Tommies, and the threat of conscription,
and the shortage of sugar and toffee for the children. In all these things, of
course, the authorities were ridiculously at fault. But Clifford could not take
it to heart. To him the authorities were ridiculous <i>ab ovo</i>, not because
of toffee or Tommies.</p>
<p>And the authorities felt ridiculous, and behaved in a rather ridiculous
fashion, and it was all a mad hatter's tea-party for a while. Till things
developed over there, and Lloyd George came to save the situation over here. And
this surpassed even ridicule, the flippant young laughed no more.</p>
<p>In 1916 Herbert Chatterley was killed, so Clifford became heir. He was
terrified even of this. His importance as son of Sir Geoffrey, and child of
Wragby, was so ingrained in him, he could never escape it. And yet he knew that
this too, in the eyes of the vast seething world, was ridiculous. Now he was
heir and responsible for Wragby. Was that not terrible? and also splendid and at
the same time, perhaps, purely absurd?</p>
<p>Sir Geoffrey would have none of the absurdity. He was pale and tense,
withdrawn into himself, and obstinately determined to save his country and his
own position, let it be Lloyd George or who it might. So cut off he was, so
divorced from the England that was really England, so utterly incapable, that he
even thought well of Horatio Bottomley. Sir Geoffrey stood for England and Lloyd
George as his forebears had stood for England and St George: and he never knew
there was a difference. So Sir Geoffrey felled timber and stood for Lloyd George
and England, England and Lloyd George.</p>
<p>And he wanted Clifford to marry and produce an heir. Clifford felt his father
was a hopeless anachronism. But wherein was he himself any further ahead, except
in a wincing sense of the ridiculousness of everything, and the paramount
ridiculousness of his own position? For willy-nilly he took his baronetcy and
Wragby with the last seriousness.</p>
<p>The gay excitement had gone out of the war...dead. Too much death and horror.
A man needed support arid comfort. A man needed to have an anchor in the safe
world. A man needed a wife.</p>
<p>The Chatterleys, two brothers and a sister, had lived curiously isolated,
shut in with one another at Wragby, in spite of all their connections. A sense of
isolation intensified the family tie, a sense of the weakness of their position,
a sense of defencelessness, in spite of, or because of, the title and the land.
They were cut off from those industrial Midlands in which they passed their
lives. And they were cut off from their own class by the brooding, obstinate,
shut-up nature of Sir Geoffrey, their father, whom they ridiculed, but whom they
were so sensitive about.</p>
<p>The three had said they would all live together always. But now Herbert was
dead, and Sir Geoffrey wanted Clifford to marry. Sir Geoffrey barely mentioned
it: he spoke very little. But his silent, brooding insistence that it should be
so was hard for Clifford to bear up against.</p>
<p>But Emma said No! She was ten years older than Clifford, and she felt his
marrying would be a desertion and a betrayal of what the young ones of the
family had stood for.</p>
<p>Clifford married Connie, nevertheless, and had his month's honeymoon with
her. It was the terrible year 1917, and they were intimate as two people who
stand together on a sinking ship. He had been virgin when he married: and the
sex part did not mean much to him. They were so close, he and she, apart from
that. And Connie exulted a little in this intimacy which was beyond sex, and
beyond a man's &quot;satisfaction&quot;. Clifford anyhow was not just keen on his
&quot;satisfaction&quot;, as so many men seemed to be. No, the intimacy was deeper, more
personal than that. And sex was merely an accident, or an adjunct, one of the
curious obsolete, organic processes which persisted in its own clumsiness, but
was not really necessary. Though Connie did want children: if only to fortify
her against her sister-in-law Emma.</p>
<p>But early in 1918 Clifford was shipped home smashed, and there was no child.
And Sir Geoffrey died of chagrin.</p>
