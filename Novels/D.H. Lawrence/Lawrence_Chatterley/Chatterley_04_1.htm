 <p>Connie always had a foreboding of the hopelessness of her affair with
      Mick, as people called him. Yet other men seemed to mean nothing to her.
      She was attached to Clifford. He wanted a good deal of her life and she
      gave it to him. But she wanted a good deal from the life of a man, and
      this Clifford did not give her; could not. There were occasional spasms of
      Michaelis. But, as she knew by foreboding, that would come to an end. Mick
      <i>couldn't </i>keep anything up. It was part of his very being that he
      must break off any connection, and be loose, isolated, absolutely lone dog
      again. It was his major necessity, even though he always said: She turned
      me down!</p>
      <p>The world is supposed to be full of possibilities, but they narrow down
      to pretty few in most personal experience. There's lots of good fish in
      the sea. . .maybe. . .but the vast masses seem to be mackerel or herring,
      and if you're not mackerel or herring yourself you are likely to find very
      few good fish in the sea.</p>
      <p>Clifford was making strides into fame, and even money. People came to
      see him. Connie nearly always had somebody at Wragby. But if they weren't
      mackerel they were herring, with an occasional cat-fish, or conger-eel.</p>
      <p>There were a few regular men, constants; men who had been at Cambridge
      with Clifford. There was Tommy Dukes, who had remained in the army, and
      was a Brigadier-General. &quot;The army leaves me time to think, and saves
      me from having to face the battle of life,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>There was Charles May, an Irishman, who wrote scientifically about
      stars. There was Hammond, another writer. All were about the same age as
      Clifford; the young intellectuals of the day. They all believed in the
      life of the mind. What you did apart from that was your private affair,
      and didn't much matter. No one thinks of inquiring of another person at
      what hour he retires to the privy. It isn't interesting to anyone but the
      person concerned.</p>
      <p>And so with most of the matters of ordinary life. . .how you make your
      money, or whether you love your wife, or if you have &quot;affairs&quot;.
      All these matters concern only the person concerned, and, like going to
      the privy, have no interest for anyone else.</p>
      <p>&quot;The whole point about the sexual problem,&quot; said Hammond, who
      was a tall thin fellow with a wife and two children, but much more closely
      connected with a typewriter, &quot;is that there is no point to it.
      Strictly there is no problem. We don't want to follow a man into the W.C.,
      so why should we want to follow him into bed with a woman? And therein
      lies the problem. If we took no more notice of the one thing than the
      other, there'd be no problem. It's all utterly senseless and pointless; a
      matter of misplaced curiosity.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Quite, Hammond, quite! But if someone starts making love to
      Julia, you begin to simmer; and if he goes on, you are soon at boiling
      point.&quot;. . .Julia was Hammond's wife.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, exactly! So I should be if he began to urinate in a corner
      of my drawing-room. There's a place for all these things.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You mean you wouldn't mind if he made love to Julia in some
      discreet alcove?&quot;</p>
      <p>Charlie May was slightly satirical, for he had flirted a very little
      with Julia, and Hammond had cut up very roughly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Of course I should mind. Sex is a private thing between me and
      Julia; and of course I should mind anyone else trying to mix in.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;As a matter of fact,&quot; said the lean and freckled Tommy
      Dukes, who looked much more Irish than May, who was pale and rather fat:
      &quot;As a matter of fact, Hammond, you have a strong property instinct,
      and a strong will to self-assertion, and you want success. Since I've been
      in the army definitely, I've got out of the way of the world, and now I
      see how inordinately strong the craving for self-assertion and success is
      in men. It is enormously overdeveloped. All our individuality has run that
      way. And of course men like you think you'll get through better with a
      woman's backing. That's why you're so jealous. That's what sex is to you.
      . .a vital little dynamo between you and Julia, to bring success. If you
      began to be unsuccessful you'd begin to flirt, like Charlie, who isn't
      successful. Married people like you and Julia have labels on you, like
      travellers' trunks. Julia is labelled <i>Mrs. Arnold B. Hammond</i>. .
      .just like a trunk on the railway that belongs to somebody. And you are
      labelled Arnold B. Hammond, <i>c/o Mrs. Arnold B. Hammond. </i>Oh, you're
      quite right, you're quite right! The life of the mind needs a comfortable
      house and decent cooking. You're quite right. It even needs posterity. But
      it all hinges on the instinct for success. That is the pivot on which all
      things turn.&quot;</p>
      <p>Hammond looked rather piqued. He was rather proud of the integrity of
      his mind, and of his <i>not </i>being a time-server. None the less, he did
      want success.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's quite true, you can't live without cash,&quot; said May.
      &quot;You've got to have a certain amount of it to be able to live and get
      along. . .even to be free to <i>think </i>you must have a certain amount
      of money, or your stomach stops you. But it seems to me you might leave
      the labels off sex. We're free to talk to anybody; so why shouldn't we be
      free to make love to any woman who inclines us that way?'</p>
      <p>&quot;There speaks the lascivious Celt,&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Lascivious! well, why not--? I can't see I do a woman any more
      harm by sleeping with her than by dancing with her. . .or even talking to
      her about the weather. It's just an interchange of sensations instead of
      ideas, so why not?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Be as promiscuous as the rabbits!&quot; said Hammond.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why not? What's wrong with rabbits? Are they any worse than a
      neurotic, revolutionary humanity, full of nervous hate?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But we're not rabbits, even so,&quot; said Hammond.</p>
      <p>&quot;Precisely! I have my mind: I have certain calculations to make in
      certain astronomical matters that concern me almost more than life or
      death. Sometimes indigestion interferes with me. Hunger would interfere
      with me disastrously. In the same way starved sex interferes with me. What
      then?&quot;</p>
