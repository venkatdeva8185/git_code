 <p>Ah yes, to be passionate like a Bacchante, like a Bacchanal fleeing
      through the woods, to call on Iacchos, the bright phallos that had no
      independent personality behind it, but was pure god-servant to the woman!
      The man, the individual, let him not dare intrude. He was but a
      temple-servant, the bearer and keeper of the bright phallos, her own.</p>
      <p>So, in the flux of new awakening, the old hard passion flamed in her
      for a time, and the man dwindled to a contemptible object, the mere
      phallos-bearer, to be torn to pieces when his service was performed. She
      felt the force of the Bacchae in her limbs and her body, the woman
      gleaming and rapid, beating down the male; but while she felt this, her
      heart was heavy. She did not want it, it was known and barren, birthless;
      the adoration was her treasure.&nbsp; It was so fathomless, so soft, so
      deep and so unknown. No, no, she would give up her hard bright female
      power; she was weary of it, stiffened with it; she would sink in the new
      bath of life, in the depths of her womb and her bowels that sang the
      voiceless song of adoration. It was early yet to begin to fear the man.</p>
      <p>&quot;I walked over by Marehay, and I had tea with Mrs. Flint,&quot;
      she said to Clifford. &quot;I wanted to see the baby. It's so adorable,
      with hair like red cobwebs. Such a dear! Mr. Flint had gone to market, so
      she and I and the baby had tea together. Did you wonder where I was?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, I wondered, but I guessed you had dropped in somewhere to
      tea,&quot; said Clifford jealously. With a sort of second sight he sensed
      something new in her, something to him quite incomprehensible, hut he
      ascribed it to the baby. He thought that all that ailed Connie was that
      she did not have a baby, automatically bring one forth, so to speak.</p>
      <p>&quot;I saw you go across the park to the iron gate, my Lady,&quot;
      said Mrs. Bolton; `so I thought perhaps you'd called at the Rectory.'</p>
      <p>&quot;I nearly did, then I turned towards Marehay instead.&quot;</p>
      <p>The eyes of the two women met: Mrs. Bolton's grey and bright and
      searching; Connie's blue and veiled and strangely beautiful. Mrs. Bolton
      was almost sure she had a lover, yet how could it be, and who could it be?
      Where was there a man?</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, it's so good for you, if you go out and see a bit of company
      sometimes,' said Mrs. Bolton. &quot;I was saying to Sir Clifford, it would
      do her ladyship a world of good if she'd go out among people more.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, I'm glad I went, and such a quaint dear cheeky baby,
      Clifford,&quot; said Connie. &quot;It's got hair just like spider-webs,
      and bright orange, and the oddest, cheekiest, pale-blue china eyes. Of
      course it's a girl, or it wouldn't be so bold, bolder than any little Sir
      Francis Drake.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You're right, my Lady---a regular little Flint. They were always
      a forward sandy-headed family,&quot; said Mrs. Bolton.</p>
      <p>&quot;Wouldn't you like to see it, Clifford? I've asked them to tea for
      you to see it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Who?&quot; he asked, looking at Connie in great uneasiness.
      &quot;Mrs. Flint and the baby, next Monday.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You can have them to tea up in your room,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, don't you want to see the baby?&quot; she cried.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I'll see it, but I don't want to sit through a tea-time with
      them.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; cried Connie, looking at him with wide veiled eyes.</p>
      <p>She did not really see him, he was somebody else.</p>
      <p>&quot;You can have a nice cosy tea up in your room, my Lady, and Mrs.
      Flint will be more comfortable than if Sir Clifford was there,&quot; said
      Mrs. Bolton.</p>
      <p>She was sure Connie had a lover, and something in her soul exulted. But
      who was he? Who was he? Perhaps Mrs. Flint would provide a clue.</p>
      <p>Connie would not take her bath this evening. The sense of his flesh
      touching her, his very stickiness upon her, was dear to her, and in a
      sense holy.</p>
      <p>Clifford was very uneasy. He would not let her go after dinner, and she
      had wanted so much to be alone. She looked at him, but was curiously
      submissive.</p>
      <p>&quot;Shall we play a game, or shall I read to you, or what shall it
      be?&quot; he asked uneasily.</p>
      <p>&quot;You read to me,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;What shall I read--verse or prose? Or drama?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Read Racine,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>It had been one of his stunts in the past, to read Racine in the real
      French grand manner, but he was rusty now, and a little self-conscious; he
      really preferred the loudspeaker. But Connie was sewing, sewing a little
      frock silk of primrose silk, cut out of one of her dresses, for Mrs.
      Flint's baby. Between coming home and dinner she had cut it out, and she
      sat in the soft quiescent rapture of herself sewing, while the noise of
      the reading went on.</p>
      <p>Inside herself she could feel the humming of passion, like the
      after-humming of deep bells.</p>
      <p>Clifford said something to her about the Racine. She caught the sense
      after the words had gone.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; she said, looking up at him. &quot;It is
      splendid.&quot;</p>
      <p>Again he was frightened at the deep blue blaze of her eyes, and of her
      soft stillness, sitting there. She had never been so utterly soft and
      still. She fascinated him helplessly, as if some perfume about her
      intoxicated him. So he went on helplessly with his reading, and the
      throaty sound of the French was like the wind in the chimneys to her. Of
      the Racine she heard not one syllable.</p>
      <p>She was gone in her own soft rapture, like a forest soughing with the
      dim, glad moan of spring, moving into bud. She could feel in the same
      world with her the man, the nameless man, moving on beautiful feet,
      beautiful in the phallic mystery. And in herself in all her veins, she
      felt him and his child. His child was in all her veins, like a twilight.</p>
      <p>&quot;For hands she hath none, nor eyes, nor feet, nor golden Treasure
      of hair. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>She was like a forest, like the dark interlacing of the oakwood,
      humming inaudibly with myriad unfolding buds. Meanwhile the birds of
      desire were asleep in the vast interlaced intricacy of her body.</p>
      <p>But Clifford's voice went on, clapping and gurgling with unusual
      sounds. How extraordinary it was! How extraordinary he was, bent there
      over the book, queer and rapacious and civilized, with broad shoulders and
      no real legs! What a strange creature, with the sharp, cold inflexible
      will of some bird, and no warmth, no warmth at all! One of those creatures
      of the afterwards, that have no soul, but an extra-alert will, cold will.
      She shuddered a little, afraid of him. But then, the soft warm flame of
      life was stronger than he, and the real things were hidden from him.</p>
      <p>The reading finished. She was startled. She looked up, and was more
      startled still to see Clifford watching her with pale, uncanny eyes, like
      hate.</p>
