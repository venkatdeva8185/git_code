 <p>The house-party, as a house-party, was distinctly boring. But this did
      not trouble the sisters. They were out all the time. Their father took
      them to the exhibition, miles and miles of weary paintings. He took them
      to all the cronies of his in the Villa Lucchese, he sat with them on warm
      evenings in the piazza, having got a table at Florian's: he took them to
      the theatre, to the Goldoni plays. There were illuminated water-fêtes,
      there were dances. This was a holiday-place of all holiday-places. The
      Lido, with its acres of sun-pinked or pajamaed bodies, was like a strand
      with an endless heap of seals come up for mating. Too many people in the
      piazza, too many limbs and trunks of humanity on the Lido, too many
      gondolas, too many motor-launches, too many steamers, too many pigeons,
      too many ices, too many cocktails, too many menservants wanting tips, too
      many languages rattling, too much, too much sun, too much smell of Venice,
      too many cargoes of strawberries, too many silk shawls, too many huge,
      raw-beef slices of watermelon on stalls: too much enjoyment, altogether
      far too much enjoyment!</p>
      <p>Connie and Hilda went around in their sunny frocks. There were dozens
      of people they knew, dozens of people knew them. Michaelis turned up like
      a bad penny. &quot;Hullo! Where you staying? Come and have an ice-cream or
      something! Come with me somewhere in my gondola.&quot; Even Michaelis
      almost sun-burned: though sun-cooked is more appropriate to the look of
      the mass of human flesh.</p>
      <p>It was pleasant in a way. It was <i>almost</i> enjoyment. But anyhow,
      with all the cocktails, all the lying in warmish water and sunbathing on
      hot sand in hot sun, jazzing with your stomach up against some fellow in
      the warm nights, cooling off with ices, it was a complete narcotic. And
      that was what they all wanted, a drug: the slow water, a drug; the sun, a
      drug; jazz, a drug; cigarettes, cocktails, ices, vermouth. To be drugged!
      Enjoyment! Enjoyment!</p>
      <p>Hilda half liked being drugged. She liked looking at all the women,
      speculating about them. The women were absorbingly interested in the
      women. How does she look! what man has she captured? what fun is she
      getting out of it?---The men were like great dogs in white flannel
      trousers, waiting to be patted, waiting to wallow, waiting to plaster some
      woman's stomach against their own, in jazz.</p>
      <p>Hilda liked jazz, because she could plaster her stomach against the
      stomach of some so-called man, and let him control her movement from the
      visceral centre, here and there across the floor, and then she could break
      loose and ignore `the creature'. He had been merely made use of. Poor
      Connie was rather unhappy. She wouldn't jazz, because she simply couldn't
      plaster her stomach against some `creature's' stomach. She hated the
      conglomerate mass of nearly nude flesh on the Lido: there was hardly
      enough water to wet them all. She disliked Sir Alexander and Lady Cooper.
      She did not want Michaelis or anybody else trailing her.</p>
      <p>The happiest times were when she got Hilda to go with her away across
      the lagoon, far across to some lonely shingle-bank, where they could bathe
      quite alone, the gondola remaining on the inner side of the reef.</p>
      <p>Then Giovanni got another gondolier to help him, because it was a long
      way and he sweated terrifically in the sun. Giovanni was very nice:
      affectionate, as the Italians are, and quite passionless. The Italians are
      not passionate: passion has deep reserves. They are easily moved, and
      often affectionate, but they rarely have any abiding passion of any sort.</p>
      <p>So Giovanni was already devoted to his ladies, as he had been devoted
      to cargoes of ladies in the past. He was perfectly ready to prostitute
      himself to them, if they wanted hint: he secretly hoped they would want
      him. They would give him a handsome present, and it would come in very
      handy, as he was just going to be married. He told them about his
      marriage, and they were suitably interested.</p>
      <p>He thought this trip to some lonely bank across the lagoon probably
      meant business: business being <i>l'amore</i>, love. So he got a mate to
      help him, for it was a long way; and after all, they were two ladies. Two
      ladies, two mackerels! Good arithmetic! Beautiful ladies, too! He was
      justly proud of them. And though it was the Signora who paid him and gave
      him orders, he rather hoped it would be the young milady who would select
      hint for <i>l'amore</i>. She would give more money too.</p>
      <p>The mate he brought was called Daniele. He was not a regular gondolier,
      so he had none of the cadger and prostitute about him. He was a sandola
      man, a sandola being a big boat that brings in fruit and produce from the
      islands.</p>
      <p>Daniele was beautiful, tall and well-shapen, with a light round head of
      little, close, pale-blond curls, and a good-looking man's face, a little
      like a lion, and long-distance blue eyes. He was not effusive, loquacious,
      and bibulous like Giovanni. He was silent and he rowed with a strength and
      ease as if he were alone on the water. The ladies were ladies, remote from
      him. He did not even look at them. He looked ahead.</p>
      <p>He was a real man, a little angry when Giovanni drank too much wine and
      rowed awkwardly, with effusive shoves of the great oar. He was a man as
      Mellors was a man, unprostituted. Connie pitied the wife of the
      easily-overflowing Giovanni. But Daniele's wife would be one of those
      sweet Venetian women of the people whom one still sees, modest and
      flower-like in the back of that labyrinth of a town.</p>
      <p>Ah, how sad that man first prostitutes woman, then woman prostitutes
      man. Giovanni was pining to prostitute himself, dribbling like a dog,
      wanting to give himself to a woman. And for money!</p>
      <p>Connie looked at Venice far off, low and rose-coloured upon the water.
      Built of money, blossomed of money, and dead with money. The
      money-deadness! Money, money, money, prostitution and deadness.</p>
      <p>Yet Daniele was still a man capable of a man's free allegiance. He did
      not wear the gondolier's blouse: only the knitted blue jersey. He was a
      little wild, uncouth and proud. So he was hireling to the rather doggy
      Giovanni who was hireling again to two women. So it is! When Jesus refused
      the devil's money, he left the devil like a Jewish banker, master of the
      whole situation.</p>
      <p>Connie would come home from the blazing light of the lagoon in a kind
      of stupor, to find letters from home. Clifford wrote regularly. He wrote
      very good letters: they might all have been printed in a book. And for
      this reason Connie found them not very interesting.</p>
      <p>She lived in the stupor of the light of the lagoon, the lapping
      saltiness of the water, the space, the emptiness, the nothingness: but
      health, health, complete stupor of health. It was gratifying, and she was
      lulled away in it, not caring for anything. Besides, she was pregnant. She
      knew now. So the stupor of sunlight and lagoon salt and sea-bathing and
      lying on shingle and finding shells and drifting away, away in a gondola,
      was completed by the pregnancy inside her, another fullness of health,
      satisfying and stupefying.</p>
