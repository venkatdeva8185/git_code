And a woman had to yield. A man was like a child with his appetites. A woman
had to yield him what he wanted, or like a child he would probably turn nasty
and flounce away and spoil what was a very pleasant connection. But a woman could
yield to a man without yielding her inner, free self. That the poets and talkers
about sex did not seem to have taken sufficiently into account. A woman could
take a man without really giving herself away. Certainly she could take him
without giving herself into his power. Rather she could use this sex thing to
have power over him. For she only had to hold herself back in sexual
intercourse, and let him finish and expend himself without herself coming to the
crisis: and then she could prolong the connection and achieve her orgasm and her
crisis while he was merely her tool.</p>
<p>Both sisters had had their love experience by the time the war came, and they
were hurried home. Neither was ever in love with a young man unless he and she
were verbally very near: that is unless they were profoundly interested, TALKING
to one another. The amazing, the profound, the unbelievable thrill there was in
passionately talking to some really clever young man by the hour, resuming day
after day for months...this they had never realised till it happened! The
paradisal promise: Thou shalt have men to talk to!--had never been uttered. It
was fulfilled before they knew what a promise it was.</p>
<p>And if after the roused intimacy of these vivid and soul-enlightened
discussions the sex thing became more or less inevitable, then let it. It marked
the end of a chapter. It had a thrill of its own too: a queer vibrating thrill
inside the body, a final spasm of self-assertion, like the last word, exciting,
and very like the row of asterisks that can be put to show the end of a
paragraph, and a break in the theme.</p>
<p>When the girls came home for the summer holidays of 1913, when Hilda was
twenty and Connie eighteen, their father could see plainly that they had had the
love experience.</p>
<p><i>L'amour avait possé par là</i>, as somebody puts it. But he was a man of
experience himself, and let life take its course. As for the mother, a nervous
invalid in the last few months of her life, she wanted her girls to be
&quot;free&quot;,
and to &quot;fulfil themselves&quot;. She herself had never been able to be altogether
herself: it had been denied her. Heaven knows why, for she was a woman who had
her own income and her own way. She blamed her husband. But as a matter of fact,
it was some old impression of authority on her own mind or soul that she could
not get rid of. It had nothing to do with Sir Malcolm, who left his nervously
hostile, high-spirited wife to rule her own roost, while he went his own way.</p>
<p>So the girls were &quot;free&quot;, and went back to Dresden, and their music, and the
university and the young men. They loved their respective young men, and their
respective young men loved them with all the passion of mental attraction. All
the wonderful things the young men thought and expressed and wrote, they thought
and expressed and wrote for the young women. Connie's young man was musical,
Hilda's was technical. But they simply lived for their young women. In their
minds and their mental excitements, that is. Somewhere else they were a little
rebuffed, though they did not know it.</p>
<p>It was obvious in them too that love had gone through them: that is, the
physical experience. It is curious what a subtle but unmistakable transmutation
it makes, both in the body of men and women: the woman more blooming, more
subtly rounded, her young angularities softened, and her expression either
anxious or triumphant: the man much quieter, more inward, the very shapes of his
shoulders and his buttocks less assertive, more hesitant.</p>
<p>In the actual sex-thrill within the body, the sisters nearly succumbed to the
strange male power. But quickly they recovered themselves, took the sex-thrill
as a sensation, and remained free. Whereas the men, in gratitude to the woman
for the sex experience, let their souls go out to her. And afterwards looked
rather as if they had lost a shilling and found sixpence. Connie's man could be
a bit sulky, and Hilda's a bit jeering. But that is how men are! Ungrateful and
never satisfied. When you don't have them they hate you because you won't; and
when you do have them they hate you again, for some other reason. Or for no
reason at all, except that they are discontented children, and can't be
satisfied whatever they get, let a woman do what she may.</p>
<p>However, came the war, Hilda and Connie were rushed home again after having
been home already in May, to their mother's funeral. Before Christmas of 1914
both their German young men were dead: whereupon the sisters wept, and loved the
young men passionately, but underneath forgot them. They didn't exist any more.</p>
<p>Both sisters lived in their father's, really their mother's, Kensington
house, and mixed with the young Cambridge group, the group that stood for
&quot;freedom&quot;
and flannel trousers, and flannel shirts open at the neck, and a well-bred sort
of emotional anarchy, and a whispering, murmuring sort of voice, and an
ultra-sensitive sort of manner. Hilda, however, suddenly married a man ten years
older than herself, an elder member of the same Cambridge group, a man with a
fair amount of money, and a comfortable family job in the government: he also
wrote philosophical essays. She lived with him in a smallish house in
Westminster, and moved in that good sort of society of people in the government
who are not tip-toppers, but who are, or would be, the real intelligent power in
the nation: people who know what they're talking about, or talk as if they did.</p>
<p>Connie did a mild form of war-work, and consorted with the flannel-trousered
Cambridge intransigents, who gently mocked at everything, so far. Her
&quot;friend&quot;
was a Clifford Chatterley, a young man of twenty-two, who had hurried home from
Bonn, where he was studying the technicalities of coal-mining. He had previously
spent two years at Cambridge. Now he had become a first lieutenant in a smart
regiment, so he could mock at everything more becomingly in uniform.</p>
<p>Clifford Chatterley was more upper-class than Connie. Connie was well-to-do
intelligentsia, but he was aristocracy. Not the big sort, but still <i>it</i>. His
father was a baronet, and his mother had been a viscount's daughter.</p>
<p>But Clifford, while he was better bred than Connie, and more
&quot;society&quot;, was
in his own way more provincial and more timid. He was at his ease in the narrow
&quot;great world&quot;, that is, landed aristocracy society, but he was shy and nervous
of all that other big world which consists of the vast hordes of the middle and
lower classes, and foreigners. If the truth must be told, he was just a little
bit frightened of middle-and lower-class humanity, and of foreigners not of his
own class. He was, in some paralysing way, conscious of his own defencelessness,
though he had all the defence of privilege. Which is curious, but a phenomenon
of our day.</p>
