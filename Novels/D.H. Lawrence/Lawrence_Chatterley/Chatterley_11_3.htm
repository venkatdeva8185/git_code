The car ploughed uphill through the long squalid straggle of Tevershall,
      the blackened brick dwellings, the black slate roofs glistening their
      sharp edges, the mud black with coal-dust, the pavements wet and black. It
      was as if dismalness had soaked through and through everything. The utter
      negation of natural beauty, the utter negation of the gladness of life,
      the utter absence of the instinct for shapely beauty which every bird and
      beast has, the utter death of the human intuitive faculty was appalling.
      The stacks of soap in the grocers' shops, the rhubarb and lemons in the
      greengrocers! the awful hats in the milliners! all went by ugly, ugly,
      ugly, followed by the plaster-and-gilt horror of the cinema with its wet
      picture announcements, &quot;A Woman's Love!&quot;, and the new big
      Primitive chapel, primitive enough in its stark brick and big panes of
      greenish and raspberry glass in the windows. The Wesleyan chapel, higher
      up, was of blackened brick and stood behind iron railings and blackened
      shrubs. The Congregational chapel, which thought itself superior, was
      built of rusticated sandstone and had a steeple, but not a very high one.
      Just beyond were the new school buildings, expensive pink brick, and
      gravelled playground inside iron railings, all very imposing, and fixing
      the suggestion of a chapel and a prison. Standard Five girls were having a
      singing lesson, just finishing the la-me-doh-la exercises and beginning a
      `sweet children's song'. Anything more unlike song, spontaneous song,
      would be impossible to imagine: a strange bawling yell that followed the
      outlines of a tune. It was not like savages: savages have subtle rhythms.
      It was not like animals: animals <i>mean</i> something when they yell. It
      was like nothing on earth, and it was called singing. Connie sat and
      listened with her heart in her boots, as Field was filling petrol. What
      could possibly become of such a people, a people in whom the living
      intuitive faculty was dead as nails, and only queer mechanical yells and
      uncanny will-power remained?</p>
      <p>A coal-cart was coming downhill, clanking in the rain. Field started
      upwards, past the big but weary-looking drapers and clothing shops, the
      post-office, into the little market-place of forlorn space, where Sam
      Black was peering out of the door of the Sun, that called itself an inn,
      not a pub, and where the commercial travellers stayed, and was bowing to
      Lady Chatterley's car.</p>
      <p>The church was away to the left among black trees. The car slid on
      downhill, past the Miners' Arms. It had already passed the Wellington, the
      Nelson, the Three Tunns, and the Sun, now it passed the Miners' Arms, then
      the Mechanics' Hall, then the new and almost gaudy Miners' Welfare and so,
      past a few new `villas', out into the blackened road between dark hedges
      and dark green fields, towards Stacks Gate.</p>
      <p>Tevershall! That was Tevershall! Merrie England! Shakespeare's England!
      No, but the England of today, as Connie had realized since she had come to
      live in it. It was producing a new race of mankind, over-conscious in the
      money and social and political side, on the spontaneous, intuitive side
      dead, but dead. Half-corpses, all of them: but with a terrible insistent
      consciousness in the other half. There was something uncanny and
      underground about it all. It was an under-world. And quite incalculable.
      How shall we understand the reactions in half-corpses? When Connie saw the
      great lorries full of steel-workers from Sheffield, weird, distorted
      smallish beings like men, off for an excursion to Matlock, her bowels
      fainted and she thought: Ah God, what has man done to man? What have the
      leaders of men been doing to their fellow men? They have reduced them to
      less than humanness; and now there can be no fellowship any more! It is
      just a nightmare.</p>
      <p>She felt again in a wave of terror the grey, gritty hopelessness of it
      all. With such creatures for the industrial masses, and the upper classes
      as she knew them, there was no hope, no hope any more. Yet she was wanting
      a baby, and an heir to Wragby! An heir to Wragby! She shuddered with
      dread.</p>
      <p>Yet Mellors had come out of all this!---Yes, but he was as apart from
      it all as she was. Even in him there was no fellowship left. It was dead.
      The fellowship was dead. There was only apartness and hopelessness, as far
      as all this was concerned. And this was England, the vast bulk of England:
      as Connie knew, since she had motored from the centre of it.</p>
      <p>The car was rising towards Stacks Gate. The rain was holding off, and
      in the air came a queer pellucid gleam of May. The country rolled away in
      long undulations, south towards the Peak, east towards Mansfield and
      Nottingham. Connie was travelling South.</p>
      <p>As she rose on to the high country, she could see on her left, on a
      height above the rolling land, the shadowy, powerful bulk of Warsop
      Castle, dark grey, with below it the reddish plastering of miners'
      dwellings, newish, and below those the plumes of dark smoke and white
      steam from the great colliery which put so many thousand pounds per annum
      into the pockets of the Duke and the other shareholders. The powerful old
      castle was a ruin, yet it hung its bulk on the low sky-line, over the
      black plumes and the white that waved on the damp air below.</p>
      <p>A turn, and they ran on the high level to Stacks Gate. Stacks Gate, as
      seen from the highroad, was just a huge and gorgeous new hotel, the
      Coningsby Arms, standing red and white and gilt in barbarous isolation off
      the road. But if you looked, you saw on the left rows of handsome `modern'
      dwellings, set down like a game of dominoes, with spaces and gardens, a
      queer game of dominoes that some weird `masters' were playing on the
      surprised earth. And beyond these blocks of dwellings, at the back, rose
      all the astonishing and frightening overhead erections of a really modern
      mine, chemical works and long galleries, enormous, and of shapes not
      before known to man. The head-stock and pit-bank of the mine itself were
      insignificant among the huge new installations. And in front of this, the
      game of dominoes stood forever in a sort of surprise, waiting to be
      played.</p>
      <p>This was Stacks Gate, new on the face of the earth, since the war. But
      as a matter of fact, though even Connie did not know it, downhill half a
      mile below the `hotel' was old Stacks Gate, with a little old colliery and
      blackish old brick dwellings, and a chapel or two and a shop or two and a
      little pub or two.</p>
