 <p>&quot;But 'appen you don't want to go away.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, yes! I don't care what happens to me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, you think that! But you'll care! You'll have to care,
      everybody has. You've got to remember your Ladyship is carrying on with a
      game-keeper. It's not as if I was a gentleman. Yes, you'd care. You'd
      care.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I shouldn't. What do I care about my ladyship! I hate it really.
      I feel people are jeering every time they say it. And they are, they are!
      Even you jeer when you say it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Me!&quot;</p>
      <p>For the first time he looked straight at her, and into her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't jeer at you,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>As he looked into her eyes she saw his own eyes go dark, quite dark,
      the pupils dilating.</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't you care about a' the risk?&quot; he asked in a husky
      voice. &quot;You should care. Don't care when it's too late!&quot;</p>
      <p>There was a curious warning pleading in his voice.</p>
      <p>&quot;But I've nothing to lose,&quot; she said fretfully. &quot;If you
      knew what it is, you'd think I'd be glad to lose it. But are you afraid
      for yourself?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!&quot; he said briefly. &quot;I am. I'm afraid. I'm afraid.
      I'm afraid O' things.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What things?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>He gave a curious backward jerk of his head, indicating the outer
      world.</p>
      <p>&quot;Things! Everybody! The lot of 'em.&quot;</p>
      <p>Then he bent down and suddenly kissed her unhappy face.</p>
      <p>&quot;Nay, I don't care,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's have it, an' damn
      the rest. But if you was to feel sorry you'd ever done it--!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't put me off,&quot; she pleaded.</p>
      <p>He put his fingers to her cheek and kissed her again suddenly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Let me come in then,&quot; he said softly. &quot;An' take off
      your mackintosh.&quot;</p>
      <p>He hung up his gun, slipped out of his wet leather jacket, and reached
      for the blankets.</p>
      <p>&quot;I brought another blanket,&quot; he said, &quot;so we can put one
      over us if you like.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I can't stay long,&quot; she said. &quot;Dinner is half-past
      seven.&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked at her swiftly, then at his watch.</p>
      <p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>He shut the door, and lit a tiny light in the hanging hurricane lamp.
      &quot;One time we'll have a long time,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>He put the blankets down carefully, one folded for her head. Then he
      sat down a moment on the stool, and drew her to him, holding her close
      with one arm, feeling for her body with his free hand. She heard the catch
      of his intaken breath as he found her. Under her frail petticoat she was
      naked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Eh! what it is to touch thee!&quot; he said, as his finger
      caressed the delicate, warm, secret skin of her waist and hips. He put his
      face down and rubbed his cheek against her belly and against her thighs
      again and again. And again she wondered a little over the sort of rapture
      it was to him. She did not understand the beauty he found in her, through
      touch upon her living secret body, almost the ecstasy of beauty. For
      passion alone is awake to it. And when passion is dead, or absent, then
      the magnificent throb of beauty is incomprehensible and even a little
      despicable; warm, live beauty of contact, so much deeper than the beauty
      of vision. She felt the glide of his cheek on her thighs and belly and
      buttocks, and the close brushing of his moustache and his soft thick hair,
      and her knees began to quiver. Far down in her she felt a new stirring, a
      new nakedness emerging. And she was half afraid. Half she wished he would
      not caress her so. He was encompassing her somehow. Yet she was waiting,
      waiting.</p>
      <p>And when he came into her, with an intensification of relief and
      consummation that was pure peace to him, still she was waiting. She felt
      herself a little left out. And she knew, partly it was her own fault. She
      willed herself into this separateness. Now perhaps she was condemned to
      it. She lay still, feeling his motion within her, his deep-sunk
      intentness, the sudden quiver of him at the springing of his seed, then
      the slow-subsiding thrust. That thrust of the buttocks, surely it was a
      little ridiculous. If you were a woman, and a part in all the business,
      surely that thrusting of the man's buttocks was supremely ridiculous.
      Surely the man was intensely ridiculous in this posture and this act!</p>
      <p>But she lay still, without recoil. Even when he had finished, she did
      not rouse herself to get a grip on her own satisfaction, as she had done
      with Michaelis; she lay still, and the tears slowly filled and ran from
      her eyes.</p>
      <p>He lay still, too. But he held her close and tried to cover her poor
      naked legs with his legs, to keep them warm. He lay on her with a close,
      undoubting warmth.</p>
      <p>&quot;Are yer cold?&quot; he asked, in a soft, small voice, as if she
      were close, so close. Whereas she was left out, distant.</p>
      <p>&quot;No! But I must go,&quot; she said gently.</p>
      <p>He sighed, held her closer, then relaxed to rest again.</p>
      <p>He had not guessed her tears. He thought she was there with him.</p>
      <p>&quot;I must go,&quot; she repeated.</p>
      <p>He lifted himself kneeled beside her a moment, kissed the inner side of
      her thighs, then drew down her skirts, buttoning his own clothes
      unthinking, not even turning aside, in the faint, faint light from the
      lantern.</p>
      <p>&quot;Tha mun come ter th' cottage one time,&quot; he said, looking
      down at her with a warm, sure, easy face.</p>
      <p>But she lay there inert, and was gazing up at him thinking: Stranger!
      Stranger! She even resented him a little.</p>
      <p>He put on his coat and looked for his hat, which had fallen, then he
      slung on his gun.</p>
      <p>&quot;Come then!&quot; he said, looking down at her with those warm,
      peaceful sort of eyes.</p>
      <p>She rose slowly. She didn't want to go. She also rather resented
      staying. He helped her with her thin waterproof and saw she was tidy.</p>
      <p>Then he opened the door. The outside was quite dark. The faithful dog
      under the porch stood up with pleasure seeing him. The drizzle of rain
      drifted greyly past upon the darkness. It was quite dark.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah mun ta'e th' lantern,&quot; he said. &quot;The'll be nob'dy.'&quot;</p>
      <p>He walked just before her in the narrow path, swinging the hurricane
      lamp low, revealing the wet grass, the black shiny tree-roots like snakes,
      wan flowers. For the rest, all was grey rain-mist and complete darkness.</p>
      <p>&quot;Tha mun come to the cottage one time,&quot; he said, &quot;shall
      ta? We might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.&quot;</p>
      <p>It puzzled her, his queer, persistent wanting her, when there was
      nothing between them, when he never really spoke to her, and in spite of
      herself she resented the dialect. His &quot;tha mun come&quot; seemed not
      addressed to her, but some common woman. She recognized the foxglove
      leaves of the riding and knew, more or less, where they were.</p>
