 <p>The irritation, and the lack of any sympathy in any direction, of
      Clifford's letter, had a bad effect on Connie. But she understood it
      better when she received the following from Mellors:</p>
      <p>&quot;The cat is out of the bag, along with various other pussies. You
      have heard that my wife Bertha came back to my unloving arms, and took up
      her abode in the cottage: where, to speak disrespectfully, she smelled a
      rat, in the shape of a little bottle of Coty. Other evidence she did not
      find, at least for some days, when she began to howl about the burnt
      photograph. She noticed the glass and the back-board in the square
      bedroom. Unfortunately, on the back-board somebody had scribbled little
      sketches, and the initials, several times repeated: C. S. R. This,
      however, afforded no clue until she broke into the hut, and found one of
      your books, an autobiography of the actress Judith, with your name,
      Constance Stewart Reid, on the front page. After this, for some days she
      went round loudly saying that my paramour was no less a person than Lady
      Chatterley herself. The news came at last to the rector, Mr. Burroughs,
      and to Sir Clifford. They then proceeded to take legal steps against my
      liege lady, who for her part disappeared, having always had a mortal fear
      of the police.</p>
      <p>Sir Clifford asked to see me, so I went to him. He talked around things
      and seemed annoyed with me. Then he asked if I knew that even her
      ladyship's name had been mentioned. I said I never listened to scandal,
      and was surprised to hear this bit from Sir Clifford himself. He said, of
      course it was a great insult, and I told him there was Queen Mary on a
      calendar in the scullery, no doubt because Her Majesty formed part of my
      harem. But he didn't appreciate the sarcasm. He as good as told me I was a
      disreputable character also walked about with my breeches' buttons undone,
      and I as good as told him he'd nothing to unbutton anyhow, so he gave me
      the sack, and I leave on Saturday week, and the place thereof shall know
      me no more.</p>
      <p>I shall go to London, and my old landlady, Mrs. Inger, 17 Coburg
      Square, will either give me a room or will find one for me.</p>
      <p>Be sure your sins will find you out, especially if you're married and
      her name's Bertha,---&quot;</p>
      <p>There was not a word about herself, or to her. Connie resented this. He
      might have said some few words of consolation or reassurance. But she knew
      he was leaving her free, free to go back to Wragby and to Clifford. She
      resented that too. He need riot be so falsely chivalrous. She wished he
      had said to Clifford: &quot;Yes, she is my lover and my mistress and I am
      proud of it!&quot; But his courage wouldn't carry him so far.</p>
      <p>So her name was coupled with his in Tevershall! It was a mess. But that
      would soon die down.</p>
      <p>She was angry, with the complicated and confused anger that made her
      inert. She did not know what to do nor what to say, so she said and did
      nothing. She went on at Venice just the same, rowing out in the gondola
      with Duncan Forbes, bathing, letting the days slip by. Duncan, who had
      been rather depressingly in love with her ten years ago, was in love with
      her again. But she said to him: &quot;I only want one thing of men, and
      that is, that they should leave me alone.&quot;</p>
      <p>So Duncan left her alone: really quite pleased to be able to. All the
      same, he offered her a soft stream of a queer, inverted sort of love. He
      wanted to be <i>with</i> her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Have you ever thought,&quot; he said to her one day, &quot;how
      very little people are connected with one another. Look at Daniele! He is
      handsome as a son of the sun. But see how alone he looks in his
      handsomeness. Yet I bet he has a wife and family, and couldn't possibly go
      away from them.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ask him,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>Duncan did so. Daniele said he was married, and had two children, both
      male, aged seven and nine. But he betrayed no emotion over the fact.</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps only people who are capable of real togetherness have
      that look of being alone in the universe,&quot; said Connie. &quot;The
      others have a certain stickiness, they stick to the mass, like
      Giovanni.&quot; `And,' she thought to herself, `like you, Duncan.'</p>
