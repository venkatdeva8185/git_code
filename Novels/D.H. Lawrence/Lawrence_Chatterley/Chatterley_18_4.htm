 <p>&quot;And shouldn't men be shot at last, if they get possessed by their
      own will?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay!--the same! But I must get free of her, or she'll be at me
      again. I wanted to tell you. I must get a divorce if I possibly can. So we
      must be careful. We mustn't really be seen together, you and I. I never, <i>never</i>
      could stand it if she came down on me and you.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie pondered this.</p>
      <p>&quot;Then we can't be together?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Not for six months or so. But I think my divorce will go through
      in September; then till March.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But the baby will probably be born at the end of February,&quot;
      she said.</p>
      <p>He was silent.</p>
      <p>&quot;I could wish the Cliffords and Berthas all dead,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's not being very tender to them,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Tender to them? Yea, even then the tenderest thing you could do
      for them, perhaps, would be to give them death. They can't live! They only
      frustrate life. Their souls are awful inside them. Death ought to be sweet
      to them. And I ought to be allowed to shoot them.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you wouldn't do it,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;I would though! and with less qualms than I shoot a weasel. It
      anyhow has a prettiness and a loneliness. But they are legion. Oh, I'd
      shoot them.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Then perhaps it is just as well you daren't.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie had now plenty to think of. It was evident he wanted absolutely
      to be free of Bertha Coutts. And she felt he was right. The last attack
      had been too grim.---This meant her living alone, till spring. Perhaps she
      could get divorced from Clifford. But how? If Mellors were named, then
      there was an end to his divorce. How loathsome! Couldn't one go right
      away, to the far ends of the earth, and be free from it all?</p>
      <p>One could not. The far ends of the world are not five minutes from
      Charing Cross, nowadays. While the wireless is active, there are no far
      ends of the earth. Kings of Dahomey and Lamas of Tibet listen in to London
      and New York.</p>
      <p>Patience! Patience! The world is a vast and ghastly intricacy of
      mechanism, and one has to be very wary, not to get mangled by it.</p>
      <p>Connie confided in her father.</p>
      <p>&quot;You see, Father, he was Clifford's game-keeper: but he was an
      officer in the army in India. Only he is like Colonel C. E. Florence, who
      preferred to become a private soldier again.&quot;</p>
      <p>Sir Malcolm, however, had no sympathy with the unsatisfactory mysticism
      of the famous C. E. Florence. He saw too much advertisement behind all the
      humility. It looked just like the sort of conceit the knight most loathed,
      the conceit of self-abasement.</p>
      <p>&quot;Where did your game-keeper spring from?&quot; asked Sir Malcolm
      irritably.</p>
      <p>&quot;He was a collier's son in Tevershall. But he's absolutely
      presentable.&quot;</p>
      <p>The knighted artist became more angry.</p>
      <p>&quot;Looks to me like a gold-digger,&quot; he said. &quot;And you're a
      pretty easy gold-mine, apparently.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, Father, it's not like that. You'd know if you saw him. He's a
      man. Clifford always detested him for not being humble.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Apparently he had a good instinct, for once.&quot;</p>
      <p>What Sir Malcolm could not bear was the scandal of his daughter's
      having an intrigue with a game-keeper. He did not mind the intrigue: he
      minded the scandal.</p>
      <p>&quot;I care nothing about the fellow. He's evidently been able to get
      round you all right. But, by God, think of all the talk. Think of your
      step-mother how she'll take it!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Connie. &quot;Talk is beastly: especially if
      you live in society. And he wants so much to get his own divorce. I
      thought we might perhaps say it was another man's child, and not mention
      Mellors' name at all.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Another man's! What other man's?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps Duncan Forbes. He has been our friend all his life.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And he's a fairly well-known artist. And he's fond of me.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Well I'm damned! Poor Duncan! And what's he going to get out of
      it?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know. But he might rather like it, even.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;He might, might he? Well, he's a funny man if he does. Why,
      you've never even had an affair with him, have you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! But he doesn't really want it. He only loves me to be near
      him, but not to touch him.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;My God, what a generation!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;He would like me most of all to be a model for him to paint from.
      Only I never wanted to.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;God help him! But he looks down-trodden enough for
      anything.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Still, you wouldn't mind so much the talk about him?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;My God, Connie, all the bloody contriving!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I know! It's sickening! But what can I do?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Contriving, conniving; conniving, contriving! Makes a man think
      he's lived too long.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Come, Father, if you haven't done a good deal of contriving and
      conniving in your time, you may talk.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But it was different, I assure you.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;It's <i>always</i> different.&quot;</p>
      <p>Hilda arrived, also furious when she heard of the new developments. And
      she also simply could not stand the thought of a public scandal about her
      sister and a game-keeper. Too, too humiliating!</p>
      <p>&quot;Why should we not just disappear, separately, to British
      Columbia, and have no scandal?&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>But that was no good. The scandal would come out just the same. And if
      Connie was going with the man, she'd better be able to marry him. This was
      Hilda's opinion. Sir Malcolm wasn't sure. The affair might still blow
      over.</p>
      <p>&quot;But will you see him, Father?&quot;</p>
      <p>Poor Sir Malcolm! he was by no means keen on it. And poor Mellors, he
      was still less keen. Yet the meeting took place: a lunch in a private room
      at the club, the two men alone, looking one another up and down.</p>
      <p>Sir Malcolm drank a fair amount of whisky, Mellors also drank. And they
      talked all the while about India, on which the young man was well
      informed.</p>
      <p>This lasted during the meal. Only when coffee was served, and the
      waiter had gone, Sir Malcolm lit a cigar and said, heartily:</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, young man, and what about my daughter?&quot;</p>
