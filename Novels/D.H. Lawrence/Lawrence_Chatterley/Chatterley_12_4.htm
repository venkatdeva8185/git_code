He took her in his arms again and drew her to him, and suddenly she
      became small in his arms, small and nestling. It was gone, the resistance
      was gone, and she began to melt in a marvellous peace. And as she melted
      small and wonderful in his arms, she became infinitely desirable to him,
      all his blood-vessels seemed to scald with intense yet tender desire, for
      her, for her softness, for the penetrating beauty of her in his arms,
      passing into his blood. And softly, with that marvellous swoon-like caress
      of his hand in pure soft desire, softly he stroked the silky slope of her
      loins, down, down between her soft warm buttocks, coming nearer and nearer
      to the very quick of her. And she felt him like a flame of desire, yet
      tender, and she felt herself melting in the flame. She let herself go. She
      felt his penis risen against her with silent amazing force and assertion
      and she let herself go to him She yielded with a quiver that was like
      death, she went all open to him. And oh, if he were not tender to her now,
      how cruel, for she was all open to him and helpless!</p>
      <p>She quivered again at the potent inexorable entry inside her, so
      strange and terrible. It might come with the thrust of a sword in her
      softly-opened body, and that would be death. She clung in a sudden anguish
      of terror. But it came with a strange slow thrust of peace, the dark
      thrust of peace and a ponderous, primordial tenderness, such as made the
      world in the beginning. And her terror subsided in her breast, her breast
      dared to be gone in peace, she held nothing. She dared to let go
      everything, all herself and be gone in the flood.</p>
      <p>And it seemed she was like the sea, nothing but dark waves rising and
      heaving, heaving with a great swell, so that slowly her whole darkness was
      in motion, and she was Ocean rolling its dark, dumb mass. Oh, and far down
      inside her the deeps parted and rolled asunder, in long, fair-travelling
      billows, and ever, at the quick of her, the depths parted and rolled
      asunder, from the centre of soft plunging, as the plunger went deeper and
      deeper, touching lower, and she was deeper and deeper and deeper
      disclosed, the heavier the billows of her rolled away to some shore,
      uncovering her, and closer and closer plunged the palpable unknown, and
      further and further rolled the waves of herself away from herself leaving
      her, till suddenly, in a soft, shuddering convulsion, the quick of all her
      plasm was touched, she knew herself touched, the consummation was upon
      her, and she was gone. She was gone, she was not, and she was born: a
      woman.</p>
      <p>Ah, too lovely, too lovely! In the ebbing she realized all the
      loveliness. Now all her body clung with tender love to the unknown man,
      and blindly to the wilting penis, as it so tenderly, frailly, unknowingly
      withdrew, after the fierce thrust of its potency. As it drew out and left
      her body, the secret, sensitive thing, she gave an unconscious cry of pure
      loss, and she tried to put it back. It had been so perfect! And she loved
      it so!</p>
      <p>And only now she became aware of the small, bud-like reticence and
      tenderness of the penis, and a little cry of wonder and poignancy escaped
      her again, her woman's heart crying out over the tender frailty of that
      which had been the power.</p>
      <p>&quot;It was so lovely!&quot; she moaned. &quot;It was so lovely!&quot;
      But he said nothing, only softly kissed her, lying still above her. And
      she moaned with a sort Of bliss, as a sacrifice, and a newborn thing.</p>
      <p>And now in her heart the queer wonder of him was awakened.&nbsp; A man!
      The strange potency of manhood upon her! Her hands strayed over him, still
      a little afraid. Afraid of that strange, hostile, slightly repulsive thing
      that he had been to her, a man. And now she touched him, and it was the
      sons of god with the daughters of men. How beautiful he felt, how pure in
      tissue! How lovely, how lovely, strong, and yet pure and delicate, such
      stillness of the sensitive body! Such utter stillness of potency and
      delicate flesh. How beautiful! How beautiful! Her hands came timorously
      down his back, to the soft, smallish globes of the buttocks. Beauty! What
      beauty! a sudden little flame of new awareness went through her. How was
      it possible, this beauty here, where she had previously only been
      repelled? The unspeakable beauty to the touch of the warm, living
      buttocks! The life within life, the sheer warm, potent loveliness. And the
      strange weight of the balls between his legs! What a mystery! What a
      strange heavy weight of mystery, that could lie soft and heavy in one's
      hand! The roots, root of all that is lovely, the primeval root of all full
      beauty.</p>
      <p>She clung to him, with a hiss of wonder that was almost awe, terror. He
      held her close, but he said nothing. He would never say anything. She
      crept nearer to him, nearer, only to be near to the sensual wonder of him.
      And out of his utter, incomprehensible stillness, she felt again the slow
      momentous, surging rise of the phallus again, the other power. And her
      heart melted out with a kind of awe.</p>
      <p>And this time his being within her was all soft and iridescent, purely
      soft and iridescent, such as no consciousness could seize. Her whole self
      quivered unconscious and alive, like plasm. She could not know what it
      was. She could not remember what it had been. Only that it had been more
      lovely than anything ever could be. Only that. And afterwards she was
      utterly still, utterly unknowing, she was not aware for how long. And he
      was still with her, in an unfathomable silence along with her. And of
      this, they would never speak.</p>
      <p>When awareness of the outside began to come back, she clung to his
      breast, murmuring `My love! My love!' And he held her silently. And she
      curled on his breast, perfect.</p>
      <p>But his silence was fathomless. His hands held her like flowers, so
      still aid strange. &quot;Where are you?&quot; she whispered to him.&nbsp;
      &quot;Where are you? Speak to me! Say something to me!&quot;</p>
      <p>He kissed her softly, murmuring: &quot;Ay, my lass!&quot;</p>
      <p>But she did not know what he meant, she did not know where he was. In
      his silence he seemed lost to her.</p>
      <p>&quot;You love me, don't you?&quot; she murmured.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, tha knows!&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;But tell me!&quot; she pleaded.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! Ay! 'asn't ter felt it?&quot; he said dimly, but softly and
      surely. And she clung close to him, closer. He was so much more peaceful
      in love than she was, and she wanted him to reassure her.</p>
      <p>&quot;You do love me!&quot; she whispered, assertive. And his hands
      stroked her softly, as if she were a flower, without the quiver of desire,
      but with delicate nearness. And still there haunted her a restless
      necessity to get a grip on love.</p>
