 <p>&quot;Oh, you're quite right!&quot; he said, turning his head away, and
      looking sideways, downwards, with that strange immobility of an old race
      that is hardly here in our present day. It was that that really made
      Connie lose her power to see him detached from herself.</p>
      <p>He looked up at her with the full glance that saw everything,
      registered everything. At the same time, the infant crying in the night
      was crying out of his breast to her, in a way that affected her very womb.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's awfully nice of you to think of me,&quot; he said
      laconically.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why shouldn't I think of you?&quot; she exclaimed, with hardly
      breath to utter it.</p>
      <p>He gave the wry, quick hiss of a laugh.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, in that way!. . .May I hold your hand for a minute?&quot; he
      asked suddenly, fixing his eyes on her with almost hypnotic power, and
      sending out an appeal that affected her direct in the womb.</p>
      <p>She stared at him, dazed and transfixed, and he went over and kneeled
      beside her, and took her two feet close in his two hands, and buried his
      face in her lap, remaining motionless. She was perfectly dim and dazed,
      looking down in a sort of amazement at the rather tender nape of his neck,
      feeling his face pressing her thighs. In all her burning dismay, she could
      not help putting her hand, with tenderness and compassion, on the
      defenceless nape of his neck, and he trembled, with a deep shudder.</p>
      <p>Then he looked up at her with that awful appeal in his full, glowing
      eyes. She was utterly incapable of resisting it. From her breast flowed
      the answering, immense yearning over him; she must give him anything,
      anything.</p>
      <p>He was a curious and very gentle lover, very gentle with the woman,
      trembling uncontrollably, and yet at the same time detached, aware, aware
      of every sound outside.</p>
      <p>To her it meant nothing except that she gave herself to him. And at
      length he ceased to quiver any more, and lay quite still, quite still.
      Then, with dim, compassionate fingers, she stroked his head, that lay on
      her breast.</p>
      <p>When he rose, he kissed both her hands, then both her feet, in their suède
      slippers, and in silence went away to the end of the room, where he stood
      with his back to her. There was silence for some minutes. Then he turned
      and came to her again as she sat in her old place by the fire.</p>
      <p>&quot;And now, I suppose you'll hate me!&quot; he said in a quiet,
      inevitable way. She looked up at him quickly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why should I?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;They mostly do,&quot; he said; then he caught himself up. &quot;I
      mean. . .a woman is supposed to.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;This is the last moment when I ought to hate you,&quot; she said
      resentfully.</p>
      <p>&quot;I know! I know! It should be so! You're <i>frightfully</i> good
      to me. . .&quot; he cried miserably.</p>
      <p>She wondered why he should be miserable. &quot;Won't you sit down
      again?&quot; she said. He glanced at the door.</p>
      <p>&quot;Sir Clifford!' he said, &quot;won't he. . .won't he be. .
      .?&quot; She paused a moment to consider. &quot;Perhaps!&quot; she said.
      And she looked up at him. &quot;I don't want Clifford to know not even to
      suspect. It would hurt him so much. But I don't think it's wrong, do
      you?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Wrong! Good God, no! You're only too infinitely good to me. . .I
      can hardly bear it.&quot;</p>
      <p>He turned aside, and she saw that in another moment he would be
      sobbing.</p>
      <p>&quot;But we needn't let Clifford know, need we?&quot; she pleaded.
      &quot;It <i>would</i> hurt him so. And if he never knows, never suspects,
      it hurts nobody.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Me!&quot; he said, almost fiercely; &quot;he'll know nothing from
      me! You see if he does. Me give myself away! Ha! Ha!&quot; he laughed
      hollowly, cynically, at such an idea. She watched him in wonder. He said
      to her: &quot;May I kiss your hand arid go? I'll run into Sheffield I
      think, and lunch there, if I may, and be back to tea. May I do anything
      for you? May I be sure you don't hate me?--and that you won't?&quot;--he
      ended with a desperate note of cynicism.</p>
      <p>&quot;No, I don't hate you,&quot; she said. &quot;I think you're
      nice.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he said to her fiercely, &quot;I'd rather you said that
      to me than said you love me! It means such a lot more. . .Till afternoon
      then. I've plenty to think about till then.&quot; He kissed her hands
      humbly and was gone.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't think I can stand that young man,&quot; said Clifford at
      lunch.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;He's such a bounder underneath his veneer. . .just waiting to
      bounce us.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I think people have been so unkind to him,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you wonder? And do you think he employs his shining hours
      doing deeds of kindness?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I think he has a certain sort of generosity.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Towards whom?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't quite know.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Naturally you don't. I'm afraid you mistake unscrupulousness for
      generosity.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie paused. Did she? It was just possible. Yet the unscrupulousness
      of Michaelis had a certain fascination for her. He went whole lengths
      where Clifford only crept a few timid paces. In his way he had conquered
      the world, which was what Clifford wanted to do. Ways and means. . .? Were
      those of Michaelis more despicable than those of Clifford? Was the way the
      poor outsider had shoved and bounced himself forward in person, and by the
      back doors, any worse than Clifford's way of advertising himself into
      prominence? The bitch-goddess, Success, was trailed by thousands of
      gasping, dogs with lolling tongues. The one that got her first was the
      real dog among dogs, if you go by success! So Michaelis could keep his
      tail up.</p>
      <p>The queer thing was, he didn't. He came back towards tea-time with a
      large handful of violets and lilies, and the same hang-dog expression.
      Connie wondered sometimes if it were a sort of mask to disarm opposition,
      because it was almost too fixed. Was he really such a sad dog?</p>
      <p>His sad-dog sort of extinguished self persisted all the evening, though
      through it Clifford felt the inner effrontery. Connie didn't feel it,
      perhaps because it was not directed against women; only against men, and
      their presumptions and assumptions. That indestructible, inward effrontery
      in the meagre fellow was what made men so down on Michaelis. His very
      presence was an affront to a man of society, cloak it as he might in an
      assumed good manner.</p>
