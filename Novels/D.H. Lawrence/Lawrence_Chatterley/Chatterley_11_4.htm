 <p>But that didn't count any more. The vast plumes of smoke and vapour
      rose from the new works up above, and this was now Stacks Gate: no
      chapels, no pubs, even no shops. Only the great works', which are the
      modern Olympia with temples to all the gods; then the model dwellings:
      then the hotel. The hotel in actuality was nothing but a miners' pub
      though it looked first-classy.</p>
      <p>Even since Connie's arrival at Wragby this new place had arisen on the
      face of the earth, and the model dwellings had filled with riff-raff
      drifting in from anywhere, to poach Clifford's rabbits among other
      occupations.</p>
      <p>The car ran on along the uplands, seeing the rolling county spread out.
      The county! It had once been a proud and lordly county. In front, looming
      again and hanging on the brow of the sky-line, was the huge and splendid
      bulk of Chadwick Hall, more window than wall, one of the most famous
      Elizabethan houses. Noble it stood alone above a great park, but out of
      date, passed over. It was still kept up, but as a show place. &quot;Look
      how our ancestors lorded it!&quot;</p>
      <p>That was the past. The present lay below. God alone knows where the
      future lies. The car was already turning, between little old blackened
      miners' cottages, to descend to Uthwaite. And Uthwaite, on a damp day, was
      sending up a whole array of smoke plumes and steam, to whatever gods there
      be. Uthwaite down in the valley, with all the steel threads of the
      railways to Sheffield drawn through it, and the coal-mines and the
      steel-works sending up smoke and glare from long tubes, and the pathetic
      little corkscrew spire of the church, that is going to tumble down, still
      pricking the fumes, always affected Connie strangely. It was an old
      market-town, centre of the dales. One of the chief inns was the Chatterley
      Arms. There, in Uthwaite, Wragby was known as Wragby, as if it were a
      whole place, not just a house, as it was to outsiders: Wragby Hall, near
      Tevershall: Wragby, a &quot;seat&quot;.</p>
      <p>The miners' cottages, blackened, stood flush on the pavement, with that
      intimacy and smallness of colliers' dwellings over a hundred years old.
      They lined all the way. The road had become a street, and as you sank, you
      forgot instantly the open, rolling country where the castles and big
      houses still dominated, but like ghosts. Now you were just above the
      tangle of naked railway-lines, and foundries and other `works' rose about
      you, so big you were only aware of walls. And iron clanked with a huge
      reverberating clank, and huge lorries shook the earth, and whistles
      screamed.</p>
      <p>Yet again, once you had got right down and into the twisted and crooked
      heart of the town, behind the church, you were in the world of two
      centuries ago, in the crooked streets where the Chatterley Arms stood, and
      the old pharmacy, streets which used to lead Out to the wild open world of
      the castles and stately couchant houses.</p>
      <p>But at the corner a policeman held up his hand as three lorries loaded
      with iron rolled past, shaking the poor old church. And not till the
      lorries were past could he salute her ladyship.</p>
      <p>So it was. Upon the old crooked burgess streets hordes of oldish
      blackened miners' dwellings crowded, lining the roads out. And immediately
      after these came the newer, pinker rows of rather larger houses,
      plastering the valley: the homes of more modern workmen. And beyond that
      again, in the wide rolling regions of the castles, smoke waved against
      steam, and patch after patch of raw reddish brick showed the newer mining
      settlements, sometimes in the hollows, sometimes gruesomely ugly along the
      sky-line of the slopes. And between, in between, were the tattered
      remnants of the old coaching and cottage England, even the England of
      Robin Hood, where the miners prowled with the dismalness of suppressed
      sporting instincts, when they were not at work.</p>
      <p>England, my England! But which is <i>my</i> England? The stately homes
      of England make good photographs, and create the illusion of a connection
      with the Elizabethans. The handsome old halls are there, from the days of
      Good Queen Anne and Tom Jones. But smuts fall and blacken on the drab
      stucco, that has long ceased to be golden. And one by one, like the
      stately homes, they were abandoned. Now they are being pulled down. As for
      the cottages of England--there they are---great plasterings of brick
      dwellings on the hopeless countryside.</p>
      <p>Now they are pulling down the stately homes, the Georgian halls are
      going. Fritchley, a perfect old Georgian mansion, was even now, as Connie
      passed in the car, being demolished. It was in perfect repair: till the
      war the Weatherleys had lived in style there. But now it was too big, too
      expensive, and the country had become too uncongenial. The gentry were
      departing to pleasanter places, where they could spend their money without
      having to see how it was made.</p>
      <p>This is history. One England blots out another. The mines had made the
      halls wealthy. Now they were blotting them out, as they had already
      blotted out the cottages. The industrial England blots out the
      agricultural England. One meaning blots out another. The new England blots
      out the old England. And the continuity is not Organic, but mechanical.</p>
      <p>Connie, belonging to the leisured classes, had clung to the remnants of
      the old England. It had taken her years to realize that it was really
      blotted out by this terrifying new and gruesome England, and that the
      blotting out would go on till it was complete. Fritchley was gone,
      Eastwood was gone, Shipley was going: Squire Winter's beloved Shipley.</p>
      <p>Connie called for a moment at Shipley. The park gates, at the back,
      opened just near the level crossing of the colliery railway; the Shipley
      colliery itself stood just beyond the trees. The gates stood open, because
      through the park was a right-of-way that the colliers used. They hung
      around the park.</p>
      <p>The car passed the ornamental ponds, in which the colliers threw their
      newspapers, and took the private drive to the house. It stood above,
      aside, a very pleasant stucco building from the middle of the eighteenth
      century. It had a beautiful alley of yew trees, that had approached an
      older house, and the hall stood serenely spread out, winking its Georgian
      panes as if cheerfully. Behind, there were really beautiful gardens.</p>
      <p>Connie liked the interior much better than Wragby. It was much lighter,
      more alive, shapen and elegant. The rooms were panelled with creamy
      painted panelling, the ceilings were touched with gilt, and everything was
      kept in exquisite order, all the appointments were perfect, regardless of
      expense. Even the corridors managed to be ample and lovely, softly curved
      and full of life.</p>
