But a child, a baby! That was still one of the sensations. She would
      venture very gingerly on that experiment. There was the man to consider,
      and it was curious, there wasn't a man in the world whose children you
      wanted. Mick's children! Repulsive thought! As lief have a child to a
      rabbit! Tommy Dukes?. . . he was very nice, but somehow you couldn't
      associate him with a baby, another generation. He ended in himself. And
      out of all the rest of Clifford's pretty wide acquaintance, there was not
      a man who did not rouse her contempt, when she thought of having a child
      by him. There were several who would have been quite possible as lover,
      even Mick. But to let them breed a child on you! Ugh! Humiliation and
      abomination.</p>
      <p>So that was that!</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Connie had the child at the back of her mind. Wait! wait!
      She would sift the generations of men through her sieve, and see if she
      couldn't find one who would do.--&quot;Go ye into the streets and by ways
      of Jerusalem, and see if you can find a <i>man</i>.&quot; It had been
      impossible to find a man in the Jerusalem of the prophet, though there
      were thousands of male humans. But a <i>man! C'est une autre chose</i>!</p>
      <p>She had an idea that he would have to be a foreigner: not an
      Englishman, still less an Irishman. A real foreigner.</p>
      <p>But wait! wait! Next winter she would get Clifford to London; the
      following winter she would get him abroad to the South of France, Italy.
      Wait! She was in no hurry about the child. That was her own private
      affair, and the one point on which, in her own queer, female way, she was
      serious to the bottom of her soul. She was not going to risk any chance
      comer, not she! One might take a lover almost at any moment, but a man who
      should beget a child on one. . .wait! wait! it's a very different
      matter.--&quot;Go ye into the streets and byways of Jerusalem. . .&quot;
      It was not a question of love; it was a question of a <i>man.</i> Why, one
      might even rather hate him, personally. Yet if he was the man, what would
      one's personal hate matter? This business concerned another part of
      oneself.</p>
      <p>It had rained as usual, and the paths were too sodden for Clifford's
      chair, but Connie would go out. She went out alone every day now, mostly
      in the wood, where she was really alone. She saw nobody there.</p>
      <p>This day, however, Clifford wanted to send a message to the keeper, and
      as the boy was laid up with influenza, -- somebody always seemed to have
      influenza at Wragby, -- Connie said she would call at the cottage.</p>
      <p>The air was soft and dead, as if all the world were slowly dying. Grey
      and clammy and silent, even from the shuffling of the collieries, for the
      pits were working short time, and today they were stopped altogether. The
      end of all things!</p>
      <p>In the wood all was utterly inert and motionless, only great drops fell
      from the bare boughs, with a hollow little crash. For the rest, among the
      old trees was depth within depth of grey, hopeless inertia, silence,
      nothingness.</p>
      <p>Connie walked dimly on. From the old wood came an ancient melancholy,
      somehow soothing to her, better than the harsh insentience of the outer
      world. She liked the <i>inwardness</i> of the remnant of forest, the
      unspeaking reticence of the old trees. They seemed a very power of
      silence, and yet a vital presence. They, too, were waiting: obstinately,
      stoically waiting, and giving off a potency of silence. Perhaps they were
      only waiting for the end; to be cut down, cleared away, the end of the
      forest, for them the end of all things. But perhaps their strong and
      aristocratic silence, the silence of strong trees, meant something else.</p>
      <p>As she came out of the wood on the north side, the keeper's cottage, a
      rather dark, brown stone cottage, with gables and a handsome chimney,
      looked uninhabited, it was so silent and alone. But a thread of smoke rose
      from the chimney, and the little railed-in garden in the front of the
      house was dug and kept very tidy. The door was shut.</p>
      <p>Now she was here she felt a little shy of the man, with his curious
      far-seeing eyes. She did not like bringing him orders, and felt like going
      away again. She knocked softly, no one came. She knocked again, but still
      not loudly. There was no answer. She peeped through the window, and saw
      the dark little room, with its almost sinister privacy, not wanting to be
      invaded.</p>
      <p>She stood and listened, and it seemed to her she heard sounds from the
      back of the cottage. Having failed to make herself heard, her mettle was
      roused, she would not be defeated.</p>
      <p>So she went round the side of the house. At the back of the cottage the
      land rose steeply, so the back yard was sunken, and enclosed by a low
      stone wall. She turned the corner of the house and stopped. In the little
      yard two paces beyond her, the man was washing himself, utterly unaware.
      He was naked to the hips, his velveteen breeches slipping down over his
      slender loins. And his white slim back was curved over a big bowl of soapy
      water, in which he ducked his head, shaking his head with a queer, quick
      little motion, lifting his slender white arms, and pressing the soapy
      water from his ears, quick, subtle as a weasel playing with water, and
      utterly alone. Connie backed away round the corner of the house, and
      hurried away to the wood. In spite of herself, she had had a shock. After
      all, merely a man washing himself, commonplace enough, Heaven knows!</p>
      <p>Yet in some curious way it was a visionary experience: it had hit her
      in the middle of the body. She saw the clumsy breeches slipping down over
      the pure, delicate, white loins, the bones showing a little, and the sense
      of aloneness, of a creature purely alone, overwhelmed her. Perfect, white,
      solitary nudity of a creature that lives alone, and inwardly alone. And
      beyond that, a certain beauty of a pure creature. Not the stuff of beauty,
      not even the body of beauty, but a lambency, the warm, white flame of a
      single life, revealing itself in contours that one might touch: a body!</p>
      <p>Connie had received the shock of vision in her womb, and she knew it;
      it lay inside her. But with her mind she was inclined to ridicule. A man
      washing himself in a back yard! No doubt with evil-smelling yellow soap!
      -- She was rather annoyed; why should she be made to stumble on these
      vulgar privacies?</p>
      <p>So she walked away from herself, but after a while she sat down on a
      stump. She was too confused to think. But in the coil of her confusion,
      she was determined to deliver her message to the fellow. She would not he
      balked. She must give him time to dress himself, but not time to go out.
      He was probably preparing to go out somewhere.</p>
