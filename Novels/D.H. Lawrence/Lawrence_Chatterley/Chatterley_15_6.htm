 <p>But he was coming back, trotting strangely, and carrying flowers. She
      was a little afraid of him, as if he were not quite human. And when he
      came near, his eyes looked into hers, but she could not understand the
      meaning.</p>
      <p>He had brought columbines and campions, and new-mown hay, and oak-tufts
      and honeysuckle in small bud. He fastened fluffy young oak-sprays round
      her breasts, sticking in tufts of bluebells and campion: and in her navel
      he poised a pink campion flower, and in her maiden-hair were
      forget-me-nots and woodruff.</p>
      <p>&quot;That's you in all your glory!&quot; he said. &quot;Lady Jane, at
      her wedding with John Thomas.&quot;</p>
      <p>And he stuck flowers in the hair of his own body, and wound a bit of
      creeping-jenny round his penis, and stuck a single bell of a hyacinth in
      his navel. She watched him with amusement, his odd intentness. And she
      pushed a campion flower in his moustache, where it stuck, dangling under
      his nose.</p>
      <p>&quot;This is John Thomas marryin' Lady Jane,&quot; he said. &quot;An'
      we mun let Constance an' Oliver go their ways. Maybe---&quot;</p>
      <p>He spread out his hand with a gesture, and then he sneezed, sneezing
      away the flowers from his nose and his navel. He sneezed again.</p>
      <p>&quot;Maybe what?&quot; she said, waiting for him to go on.</p>
      <p>He looked at her a little bewildered.</p>
      <p>&quot;Eh?&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Maybe what? Go on with what you were going to say,&quot; she
      insisted.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, what <i>was</i> I going to say?&quot;</p>
      <p>He had forgotten. And it was one of the disappointments of her life,
      that he never finished.</p>
      <p>A yellow ray of sun shone over the trees.</p>
      <p>&quot;Sun!&quot; he said. &quot;And time you went. Time, my Lady, time!
      What's that as flies without wings, your Ladyship? Time! Time!&quot;</p>
      <p>He reached for his shirt.</p>
      <p>&quot;Say goodnight! to John Thomas,&quot; he said, looking down at his
      penis. &quot;He's safe in the arms of creeping Jenny! Not much burning
      pestle about him just now.&quot;</p>
      <p>And he put his flannel shirt over his head.</p>
      <p>&quot;A man's most dangerous moment,&quot; he said, when his head had
      emerged, &quot;is when he's getting into his shirt. Then he puts his head
      in a bag. That's why I prefer those American shirts, that you put on like
      a jacket.&quot; She still stood watching him. He stepped into his short
      drawers, and buttoned them round the waist.</p>
      <p>&quot;Look at Jane!&quot; he said. &quot;In all her blossoms! Who'll
      put blossoms on you next year, Jinny? Me, or somebody else? 'Good-bye, my
      bluebell, farewell to you!' I hate that song, it's early war days.&quot;
      He then sat down, and was pulling on his stockings. She still stood
      unmoving. He laid his hand on the slope of her buttocks. &quot;Pretty
      little Lady Jane!&quot; he said. &quot;Perhaps in Venice you'll find a man
      who'll put jasmine in your maiden-hair, and a pomegranate flower in your
      navel. Poor little lady Jane!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Don't say those things!&quot; she said. &quot;You only say them
      to hurt me.&quot;</p>
      <p>He dropped his head. Then he said, in dialect:</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay, maybe I do, maybe I do! Well then, I'll say nowt, an' ha'
      done wi't. But tha mun dress thysen, all' go back to thy stately homes of
      England, how beautiful they stand. Time's up! Time's up for Sir John, an'
      for little Lady Jane! Put thy shimmy on, Lady Chatterley! Tha might be
      anybody, standin' there be-out even a shimmy, an' a few rags o' flowers.
      There then, there then, I'll undress thee, tha bob-tailed young throstle.'&quot;
      And he took the leaves from her hair, kissing her damp hair, and the
      flowers from her breasts, and kissed her breasts, and kissed her navel,
      and kissed her maiden-hair, where he left the flowers threaded. &quot;They
      mun stop while they will,&quot; he said. &quot;So! There tha'rt bare
      again, nowt but a bare-arsed lass an' a bit of a Lady Jane! Now put thy
      shimmy on, for tha mun go, or else Lady Chatterley's goin' to be late for
      dinner, an' where 'ave yer been to my pretty maid!&quot;</p>
      <p>She never knew how to answer him when he was in this condition of the
      vernacular. So she dressed herself and prepared to go a little
      ignominiously home to Wragby. Or so she felt it: a little ignominiously
      home.</p>
      <p>He would accompany her to the broad riding. His young pheasants were
      all right under the shelter.</p>
      <p>When he and she came out on to the riding, there was Mrs. Bolton
      faltering palely towards them.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, my Lady, we wondered if anything had happened!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No! Nothing has happened.&quot;</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton looked into the man's face, that was smooth and new-looking
      with love. She met his half-laughing, half-mocking eyes. He always laughed
      at mischance. But he looked at her kindly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Evening, Mrs. Bolton! Your Ladyship will be all right now, so I
      can leave you. Good-night to your Ladyship! Good-night, Mrs. Bolton!&quot;</p>
      <p>He saluted and turned away.</p>
