 <p>It was a woman's question to a woman. Mrs. Bolton put aside a strand of
      hair from her face, with the back of her hand.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't know, my Lady! He sort of wouldn't give in to things: he
      wouldn't really go with the rest. And then he hated ducking his head for
      anything on earth. A sort of obstinacy, that gets itself killed. You see
      he didn't really care. I lay it down to the pit. He ought never to have
      been down pit. But his dad made him go down, as a lad; and then, when
      you're over twenty, it's not very easy to come out.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Did he say he hated it?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh no! Never! He never said he hated anything. He just made a
      funny face. He was one of those who wouldn't take care: like some of the
      first lads as went off so blithe to the war and got killed right away. He
      wasn't really wezzle-brained. But he wouldn't care. I used to say to him:
      'You care for nought nor nobody!'' But he did! The way he sat when my
      first baby was born, motionless, and the sort of fatal eyes he looked at
      me with, when it was over! I had a bad time, but I had to comfort <i>him</i>.
      'It's all right, lad, it's all right!'' I said to him. And he gave me a
      look, and that funny sort of smile. He never said anything. But I don't
      believe he had any right pleasure with me at nights after; he'd never
      really let himself go. I used to say to him: Oh, let thysen go, lad!---I'd
      talk broad to him sometimes. And he said nothing. But he wouldn't let
      himself go, or he couldn't. He didn't want me to have any more children. I
      always blamed his mother, for letting him in th' room. He'd no right t'ave
      been there. Men makes so much more of things than they should, once they
      start brooding.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Did he mind so much?&quot; said Connie in wonder.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, he sort of couldn't take it for natural, all that pain. And
      it spoilt his pleasure in his bit of married love. I said to him: If I
      don't care, why should you? It's my look-out!---But all he'd ever say was:
      It's not right!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Perhaps he was too sensitive,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;That's it! When you come to know men, that's how they are: too
      sensitive in the wrong place. And I believe, unbeknown to himself he hated
      the pit, just hated it. He looked so quiet when he was dead, as if he'd
      got free. He was such a nice-looking lad. It just broke my heart to see
      him, so still and pure looking, as if he'd <i>wanted</i> to die. Oh, it
      broke my heart, that did. But it was the pit.&quot;</p>
      <p>She wept a few bitter tears, and Connie wept more. It was a warm spring
      day, with a perfume of earth and of yellow flowers, many things rising to
      bud, and the garden still with the very sap of sunshine.</p>
      <p>&quot;It must have been terrible for you!&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, my Lady! I never realized at first. I could only say: Oh my
      lad, what did you want to leave me for!---That was all my cry. But somehow
      I felt he'd come back.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But he <i>didn't</i> want to leave you,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh no, my Lady! That was only my silly cry. And I kept expecting
      him back. Especially at nights. I kept waking up thinking: Why he's not in
      bed with me!---It was as if <i>my feelings</i> wouldn't believe he'd gone.
      I just felt he'd <i>have</i> to come back and lie against me, so I could
      feel him with me. That was all I wanted, to feel him there with me, warm.
      And it took me a thousand shocks before I knew he wouldn't come back, it
      took me years.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The touch of him,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;That's it, my Lady, the touch of him! I've never got over it to
      this day, and never shall. And if there's a heaven above, he'll be there,
      and will lie up against me so I can sleep.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie glanced at the handsome, brooding face in fear. Another
      passionate one out of Tevershall! The touch of him! For the bonds of love
      are ill to loose!</p>
      <p>&quot;It's terrible, once you've got a man into your blood!&quot; she
      said. &quot;Oh, my Lady! And that's what makes you feel so bitter. You
      feel folks <i>wanted</i> him killed. You feel the pit fair <i>wanted</i>
      to kill him. Oh, I felt, if it hadn't been for the pit, an' them as runs
      the pit, there'd have been no leaving me. But they all <i>want</i> to
      separate a woman and a man, if they're together.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;If they're physically together,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;That's right, my Lady! There's a lot of hard-hearted folks in the
      world. And every morning when he got up and went to th' pit, I felt it was
      wrong, wrong. But what else could he do? What can a man do?&quot;</p>
      <p>A queer hate flared in the woman.</p>
      <p>&quot;But can a touch last so long?&quot; Connie asked suddenly.
      &quot;That you could feel him so long?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, my Lady, what else is there to last? Children grows away from
      you. But the man, well! But even <i>that</i> they'd like to kill in you,
      the very thought of the touch of him. Even your own children! Ah well! We
      might have drifted apart, who knows. But the feeling's something
      different. It's 'appen better never to care. But there, when I look at
      women who's never really been warmed through by a man, well, they seem to
      me poor dool-owls after all, no matter how they may dress up and gad. No,
      I'll abide by my own. I've not much respect for people.&quot;</p>
