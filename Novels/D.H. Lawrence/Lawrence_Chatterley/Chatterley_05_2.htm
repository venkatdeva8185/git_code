 <p>&quot;But what about the other man?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Does it matter very much? Do these things really affect us very
      deeply?. . .You had that lover in Germany. . .what is it now? Nothing
      almost. It seems to me that it isn't these little acts and little
      connections we make in our lives that matter so very much. They pass away,
      and where are they? Where. . .Where are the snows of yesteryear?. . .It's
      what endures through one's life that matters; my own life matters to me,
      in its long continuance and development. But what do the occasional
      connections matter? And the occasional sexual connections especially! If
      people don't exaggerate them ridiculously, they pass like the mating of
      birds. And so they should. What does it matter? It's the life-long
      companionship that matters. It's the living together from day to day, not
      the sleeping together once or twice. You and I are married, no matter what
      happens to us. We have the habit of each other. And habit, to my thinking,
      is more vital than any occasional excitement. The long, slow, enduring
      thing. . .that's what we live by. . .not the occasional spasm of any sort.
      Little by little, living together, two people fall into a sort of unison,
      they vibrate so intricately to one another. That's the real secret of
      marriage, not sex; at least not the simple function of sex. You and I are
      interwoven in a marriage. If we stick to that we ought to be able to
      arrange this sex thing, as we arrange going to the dentist; since fate has
      given us a checkmate physically there.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie sat and listened in a sort of wonder, and a sort of fear. She
      did not know if he was right or not. There was Michaelis, whom she loved;
      so she said to herself. But her love was somehow only an excursion from
      her marriage with Clifford; the long, slow habit of intimacy, formed
      through years of suffering and patience. Perhaps the human soul needs
      excursions, and must not be denied them. But the point of an excursion is
      that you come home again.</p>
      <p>&quot;And wouldn't you mind <i>what</i> man's child I had?&quot; she
      asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, Connie, I should trust your natural instinct of decency and
      selection. You just wouldn't let the wrong sort of fellow touch you.&quot;</p>
      <p>She thought of Michaelis! He was absolutely Clifford's idea of the
      wrong sort of fellow.</p>
      <p>&quot;But men and women may have different feelings about the wrong
      sort of fellow,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;No,&quot; he replied. &quot;You care for me. I don't believe you
      would ever care for a man who was purely antipathetic to me. Your rhythm
      wouldn't let you.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was silent. Logic might be unanswerable because it was so
      absolutely wrong.</p>
      <p>&quot;And should you expect me to tell you?&quot; she asked, glancing
      up at him almost furtively.</p>
      <p>&quot;Not at all, I'd better not know. . .But you do agree with me,
      don't you, that the casual sex thing is nothing, compared to the long life
      lived together? Don't you think one can just subordinate the sex thing to
      the necessities of a long life? Just use it, since that's what we're
      driven to? After all, do these temporary excitements matter? Isn't the
      whole problem of life the slow building up of an integral personality,
      through the years? living an integrated life? There's no point in a
      disintegrated life. If lack of sex is going to disintegrate you, then go
      out and have a love-affair. If lack of a child is going to disintegrate
      you, then have a child if you possibly can. But only do these things so
      that you have an integrated life, that makes a long harmonious thing. And
      you and I can do that together. . .don't you think?. . .if we adapt
      ourselves to the necessities, and at the same time weave the adaptation
      together into a piece with our steadily-lived life. Don't you agree?'</p>
      <p>Connie was a little overwhelmed by his words. She knew he was right
      theoretically. But when she actually touched her steadily-lived life with
      him she. . .hesitated. Was it actually her destiny to go on weaving
      herself into his life all the rest of her life? Nothing else?</p>
      <p>Was it just that? She was to be content to weave a steady life with
      him, all one fabric, but perhaps brocaded with the occasional flower of an
      adventure. But how could she know what she would feel next year? How could
      one ever know? How could one say Yes? for years and years? The little yes,
      gone on a breath! Why should one be pinned down by that butterfly word? Of
      course it had to flutter away and be gone, to be followed by other yes's
      and no's! Like the straying of butterflies.</p>
      <p>&quot;I think you're right, Clifford. And as far as I can see I agree
      with you. Only life may turn quite a new face on it all.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But until life turns a new face on it all, you do agree?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh yes! I think I do, really.&quot;</p>
      <p>She was watching a brown spaniel that had run out of a side-path, and
      was looking towards them with lifted nose, making a soft, fluffy bark. A
      man with a gun strode swiftly, softly out after the dog, facing their way
      as if about to attack them; then stopped instead, saluted, and was turning
      downhill. It was only the new game-keeper, but he had frightened Connie,
      he seemed to emerge with such a swift menace. That was how she had seen
      him, like the sudden rush of a threat out of nowhere.</p>
      <p>He was a man in dark green velveteens and gaiters. . .the old style,
      with a red face and red moustache and distant eyes. He was going quickly
      downhill.</p>
      <p>&quot;Mellors!&quot; called Clifford.</p>
      <p>The man faced lightly round, and saluted with a quick little gesture, a
      soldier!</p>
      <p>&quot;Will you turn the chair round and get it started? That makes it
      easier,&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>The man at once slung his gun over his shoulder, and came forward with
      the same curious swift, yet soft movements, as if keeping invisible. He
      was moderately tall and lean, and was silent. He did not look at Connie at
      all, only at the chair.</p>
      <p>&quot;Connie, this is the new game-keeper, Mellors. You haven't spoken
      to her ladyship yet, Mellors?'&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No, Sir!&quot; came the ready, neutral words.</p>
      <p>The man lifted his hat as he stood, showing his thick, almost fair
      hair. He stared straight into Connie's eyes, with a perfect, fearless,
      impersonal look, as if he wanted to see what she was like. He made her
      feel shy. She bent her head to him shyly, and he changed his hat to his
      left hand and made her a slight bow, like a gentleman; but he said nothing
      at all. He remained for a moment still, with his hat in his hand.</p>
      <p>&quot;But you've been here some time, haven't you?&quot; Connie said to
      him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Eight months, Madam. . .your Ladyship!&quot; he corrected himself
      calmly.</p>
      <p>&quot;And do you like it?&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked him in the eyes. His eyes narrowed a little, with irony,
      perhaps with impudence.</p>
      <p>&quot;Why, yes, thank you, your Ladyship! I was reared here. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>He gave another slight bow, turned, put his hat on, and strode to take
      hold of the chair. His voice on the last words had fallen into the heavy
      broad drag of the dialect. . .perhaps also in mockery, because there had
      been no trace of dialect before. He might almost be a gentleman. Anyhow,
      he was a curious, quick, separate fellow, alone, but sure of himself.</p>
