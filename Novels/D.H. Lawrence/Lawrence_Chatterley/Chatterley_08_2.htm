 <p>This place was a little sinister, cold, damp. Yet the well must have
      been a drinking-place for hundreds of years. Now no more. Its tiny cleared
      space was lush and cold and dismal.</p>
      <p>She rose and went slowly towards home. As she went she heard a faint
      tapping away on the right, and stood still to listen. Was it hammering, or
      a woodpecker? It was surely hammering.</p>
      <p>She walked on, listening. And then she noticed a narrow track between
      young fir-trees, a track that seemed to lead nowhere. But she felt it had
      been used. She turned down it adventurously, between the thick young firs,
      which gave way soon to the old oak wood. She followed the track, and the
      hammering grew nearer, in the silence of the windy wood, for trees make a
      silence even in their noise of wind.</p>
      <p>She saw a secret little clearing, and a secret little hot made of
      rustic poles. And she had never been here before! She realized it was the
      quiet place where the growing pheasants were reared; the keeper in his
      shirt-sleeves was kneeling, hammering. The dog trotted forward with a
      short, sharp bark, and the keeper lifted his face suddenly and saw her. He
      had a startled look in his eyes.</p>
      <p>He straightened himself and saluted, watching her in silence, as she
      came forward with weakening limbs. He resented the intrusion; he cherished
      his solitude as his only and last freedom in life.</p>
      <p>&quot;I wondered what the hammering was,&quot; she said, feeling weak
      and breathless, and a little afraid of him, as he looked so straight at
      her.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah'm gettin' th' coops ready for th' young bods,'&quot; he said,
      in broad vernacular.</p>
      <p>She did not know what to say, and she felt weak.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;I should like to sit down a bit,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Come and sit 'ere i' th' 'ut,&quot; he said, going in front of
      her to the hut, pushing aside some timber and stuff, and drawing out a
      rustic chair, made of hazel sticks.</p>
      <p>&quot;Am Ah t' light yer a little fire?&quot; he asked, with the
      curious naïveté of the dialect.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, don't bother,&quot; she replied.</p>
      <p>But he looked at her hands; they were rather blue. So he quickly took
      some larch twigs to the little brick fire-place in the corner, and in a
      moment the yellow flame was running up the chimney. He made a place by the
      brick hearth.</p>
      <p>&quot;Sit 'ere then a bit, and warm yer,'&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>She obeyed him. He had that curious kind of protective authority she
      obeyed at once. So she sat and warmed her hands at the blaze, and dropped
      logs on the fire, whilst outside he was hammering again. She did not
      really want to sit, poked in a corner by the fire; she would rather have
      watched from the door, but she was being looked after, so she had to
      submit.</p>
      <p>The hut was quite cosy, panelled with unvarnished deal, having a little
      rustic table and stool beside her chair, and a carpenter's bench, then a
      big box, tools, new boards, nails; and many things hung from pegs: axe,
      hatchet, traps, things in sacks, his coat. It had no window, the light
      came in through the open door. It was a jumble, but also it was a sort of
      little sanctuary.</p>
      <p>She listened to the tapping of the man's hammer; it was not so happy.
      He was oppressed. Here was a trespass on his privacy, and a dangerous one!
      A woman! He had reached the point where all he wanted on earth was to be
      alone. And yet he was powerless to preserve his privacy; he was a hired
      man, and these people were his masters.</p>
      <p>Especially he did not want to come into contact with a woman again. He
      feared it; for he had a big wound from old contacts. He felt if he could
      not be alone, and if he could not be left alone, he would die. His recoil
      away from the outer world was complete; his last refuge was this wood; to
      hide himself there!</p>
      <p>Connie grew warm by the fire, which she had made too big: then she grew
      hot. She went and sat on the stool in the doorway, watching the man at
      work. He seemed not to notice her, but he knew. Yet he worked on, as if
      absorbedly, and his brown dog sat on her tail near him, and surveyed the
      untrustworthy world.</p>
      <p>Slender, quiet and quick, the man finished the coop he was making,
      turned it over, tried the sliding door, then set it aside. Then he rose,
      went for an old coop, and took it to the chopping log where he was
      working. Crouching, he tried the bars; some broke in his hands; he began
      to draw the nails. Then he turned the coop over and deliberated, and he
      gave absolutely no sign of awareness of the woman's presence.</p>
      <p>So Connie watched him fixedly. And the same solitary aloneness she had
      seen in him naked, she now saw in him clothed: solitary, and intent, like
      an animal that works alone, but also brooding, like a soul that recoils
      away, away from all human contact. Silently, patiently, he was recoiling
      away from her even now. It was the stillness, and the timeless sort of
      patience, in a man impatient and passionate, that touched Connie's womb.
      She saw it in his bent head, the quick quiet hands, the crouching of his
      slender, sensitive loins; something patient and withdrawn. She felt his
      experience had been deeper and wider than her own; much deeper and wider,
      and perhaps more deadly. And this relieved her of herself; she felt almost
      irresponsible.</p>
