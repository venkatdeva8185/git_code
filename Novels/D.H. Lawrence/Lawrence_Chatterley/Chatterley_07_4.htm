 <p>But Connie's heart simply stood still at the thought of abandoning
      Clifford there and then. She couldn't do it. No. . .no! She just couldn't.
      She had to go back to Wragby.</p>
      <p>Michaelis was disgusted. Hilda didn't like Michaelis, but she <i>almost</i>
      preferred him to Clifford. Back went the sisters to the Midlands.</p>
      <p>Hilda talked to Clifford, who still had yellow eyeballs when they got
      back. He, too, in his way, was overwrought; but he had to listen to all
      Hilda said, to all the doctor had said, not what Michaelis had said, of
      course, and he sat mum through the ultimatum.</p>
      <p>&quot;Here is the address of a good manservant, who was with an invalid
      patient of the doctor's till he died last month. He is really a good man,
      and fairly sure to come.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But I'm <i>not</i> an invalid, and I will <i>not</i> have a
      manservant,&quot; said Clifford, poor devil.</p>
      <p>&quot;And here are the addresses of two women; I saw one of them, she
      would do very well; a woman of about fifty, quiet, strong, kind, and in
      her way cultured. . .&quot;</p>
      <p>Clifford only sulked, and would not answer.</p>
      <p>&quot;Very well, Clifford. If we don't settle something by to-morrow, I
      shall telegraph to Father, and we shall take Connie away.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Will Connie go?&quot; asked Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;She doesn't want to, but she knows she must. Mother died of
      cancer, brought on by fretting. We're not running any risks.&quot;</p>
      <p>So next day Clifford suggested Mrs. Bolton, Tevershall parish nurse.
      Apparently Mrs. Betts had thought of her. Mrs. Bolton was just retiring
      from her parish duties to take up private nursing jobs. Clifford had a
      queer dread of delivering himself into the hands of a stranger, but this
      Mrs. Bolton had once nursed him through scarlet fever, and he knew her.</p>
      <p>The two sisters at once called on Mrs. Bolton, in a newish house in a
      row, quite select for Tevershall. They found a rather good-looking woman
      of forty-odd, in a nurse's uniform, with a white collar and apron, just
      making herself tea in a small crowded sitting-room.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Bolton was most attentive and polite, seemed quite nice, spoke
      with a bit of a broad slur, but in heavily correct English, and from
      having bossed the sick colliers for a good many years, had a very good
      opinion of herself, and a fair amount of assurance. In short, in her tiny
      way, one of the governing class in the village, very much respected.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, Lady Chatterley's not looking at all well! Why, she used to
      be that bonny, didn't she now? But she's been failing all winter! Oh, it's
      hard, it is. Poor Sir Clifford! Eh, that war, it's a lot to answer
      for.&quot;</p>
      <p>And Mrs. Bolton would come to Wragby at once, if Dr. Shardlow would let
      her off. She had another fortnight's parish nursing to do, by rights, but
      they might get a substitute, you know.</p>
      <p>Hilda posted off to Dr. Shardlow, and on the following Sunday Mrs.
      Bolton drove up in Leiver's cab to Wragby with two trunks. Hilda had talks
      with her; Mrs. Bolton was ready at any moment to talk. And she seemed so
      young! The way the passion would flush in her rather pale cheek. She was
      forty-seven.</p>
      <p>Her husband, Ted Bolton, had been killed in the pit, twenty-two years
      ago, twenty-two years last Christmas, just at Christmas time, leaving her
      with two children, one a baby in arms. Oh, the baby was married now,
      Edith, to a young man in Boots Cash Chemists in Sheffield. The other one
      was a schoolteacher in Chesterfield; she came home weekends, when she
      wasn't asked out somewhere. Young folks enjoyed themselves nowadays, not
      like when she, Ivy Bolton, was young.</p>
      <p>Ted Bolton was twenty-eight when lie was killed in an explosion down th'
      pit. The butty in front shouted to them all to lie down quick, there were
      four of them. And they all lay down in time, only Ted, and it killed him.
      Then at the inquiry, on the masters' side they said Ted had been
      frightened, and trying to run away, and not obeying orders, so it was like
      his fault really. So the compensation was only three hundred pounds, and
      they made out as if it was more of a gift than legal compensation, because
      it was really the man's own fault. And they wouldn't let her have the
      money down; she wanted to have a little shop. But they said she'd no doubt
      squander it, perhaps in drink! So she had to draw it thirty shillings a
      week. Yes, she had to go every Monday morning down to the offices, and
      stand there a couple of hours waiting her turn; yes, for almost four years
      she went every Monday. And what could she do with two little children on
      her hands? But Ted's mother was very good to her. When the baby could
      toddle she'd keep both the children for the day, while she, Ivy Bolton,
      went to Sheffield, and attended classes in ambulance, and then the fourth
      year she even took a nursing course and got qualified. She was determined
      to be independent and keep her children. So she was assistant at Uthwaite
      hospital, just a little place, for a while. But when the Company, the
      Tevershall Colliery Company, really Sir Geoffrey, saw that she could get
      on by herself, they were very good to her, gave her the parish nursing,
      and stood by her, she would say that for them. And she'd done it ever
      since, till now it was getting a bit much for her; she needed something a
      bit lighter, there was such a lot of traipsing around if you were a
      district nurse.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, the Company's been very good to <i>me</i>, I always say it.
      But I should never forget what they said about Ted, for he was as steady
      and fearless a chap as ever set foot on the cage, and it was as good as
      branding him a coward. But there, he was dead, and could say nothing to
      none of 'em.&quot;</p>
      <p>It was a queer mixture of feelings the woman showed as she talked. She
      liked the colliers, whom she had nursed for so long; but she felt very
      superior to them. She felt almost upper class; and at the same time a
      resentment against the ruling class smouldered in her. The masters! In a
      dispute between masters and men, she was always for the men. But when
      there was no question of contest, she was pining to be superior, to be one
      of the upper class. The upper classes fascinated her, appealing to her
      peculiar English passion for superiority. She was thrilled to come to
      Wragby; thrilled to talk to Lady Chatterley, my word, different from the
      common colliers' wives! She said so in so many words. Yet one could see a
      grudge against the Chatterleys peep out in her; the grudge against the
      masters.</p>
