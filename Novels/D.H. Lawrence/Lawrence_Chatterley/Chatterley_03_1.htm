 <p>Connie was aware, however, of a growing restlessness. Out of her
      disconnection, a restlessness was taking possession of her like madness.
      It twitched her limbs when she didn't want to twitch them, it jerked her
      spine when she didn't want to jerk upright but preferred to rest
      comfortably. It thrilled inside her body, in her womb, somewhere, till she
      felt she must jump into water and swim to get away from it; a mad
      restlessness. It made her heart beat violently for no reason. And she was
      getting thinner.</p>
      <p>It was just restlessness. She would rush off across the park, abandon
      Clifford, and lie prone in the bracken. To get away from the house. . .she
      must get away from the house and everybody. The wood was her one refuge,
      her sanctuary.</p>
      <p>But it was not really a refuge, a sanctuary, because she had no
      connection with it. It was only a place where she could get away from the
      rest. She never really touched the spirit of the wood itself. . .if it had
      any such nonsensical thing.</p>
      <p>Vaguely she knew herself that she was going to pieces in some way.
      Vaguely she knew she was out of connection: she had lost touch with the
      substantial and vital world. Only Clifford and his books, which did not
      exist. . .which had nothing in them! Void to void. Vaguely she knew. But
      it was like beating her head against a stone.</p>
      <p>Her father warned her again: &quot;Why don't you get yourself a beau,
      Connie? Do you all the good in the world.&quot;</p>
      <p>That winter Michaelis came for a few days. He was a young Irishman who
      had already made a large fortune by his plays in America. He had been
      taken up quite enthusiastically for a time by smart society in London, for
      he wrote smart society plays. Then gradually smart society realized that
      it had been made ridiculous at the hands of a down-at-heel Dublin
      street-rat, and revulsion came. Michaelis was the last word in what was
      caddish and bounderish. He was discovered to be anti-English, and to the
      class that made this discovery this was worse than the dirtiest crime. He
      was cut dead, and his corpse thrown into the refuse can.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless Michaelis had his apartment in Mayfair, and walked down
      Bond Street the image of a gentleman, for you cannot get even the best
      tailors to cut their low-down customers, when the customers pay.</p>
      <p>Clifford was inviting the young man of thirty at an inauspicious moment
      in that&nbsp; young man's career. Yet Clifford did not hesitate. Michaelis
      had the ear of a few million people, probably; and, being a hopeless
      outsider, he would no doubt be grateful to be asked down to Wragby at this
      juncture, when the rest of the smart world was cutting him. Being
      grateful, he would no doubt do Clifford `good' over there in America.
      Kudos! A man gets a lot of kudos, whatever that may be, by being talked
      about in the right way, especially &quot;over there&quot;. Clifford was a
      coming man; and it was remarkable what a sound publicity instinct he had.
      In the end Michaelis did him most nobly in a play, and Clifford was a sort
      of popular hero. Till the reaction, when he found he had been made
      ridiculous.</p>
      <p>Connie wondered a little over Clifford's blind, imperious instinct to
      become known: known, that is, to the vast amorphous world he did not
      himself know, and of which he was uneasily afraid; known as a writer, as a
      first-class modern writer. Connie was aware from successful, old, hearty,
      bluffing Sir Malcolm, that artists did advertise themselves, and exert
      themselves to put their goods over. But her father used channels
      ready-made, used by all the other R.A.'s who sold their pictures. Whereas
      Clifford discovered new channels of publicity, all kinds. He had all kinds
      of people at Wragby, without exactly lowering himself. But, determined to
      build himself a monument of a reputation quickly, he used any handy rubble
      in the making.</p>
      <p>Michaelis arrived duly, in a very neat car, with a chauffeur and a
      manservant. He was absolutely Bond Street! But at right of him something
      in Clifford's county soul recoiled. He wasn't exactly. . . not exactly. .
      .in fact, he wasn't at all, well, what his appearance intended to imply.
      To Clifford this was final and enough. Yet he was very polite to the man;
      to the amazing success in him. The bitch-goddess, as she is called, of
      Success, roamed, snarling and protective, round the half-humble,
      half-defiant Michaelis' heels, and intimidated Clifford completely: for he
      wanted to prostitute himself to the bitch-goddess, Success also, if only
      she would have him.</p>
      <p>Michaelis obviously wasn't an Englishman, in spite of all the tailors,
      hatters, barbers, booters of the very best quarter of London. No, no, he
      obviously wasn't an Englishman: the wrong sort of flattish, pale face and
      bearing; and the wrong sort of grievance. He had a grudge and a grievance:
      that was obvious to any true-born English gentleman, who would scorn to
      let such a thing appear blatant in his own demeanour. Poor Michaelis had
      been much kicked, so that he had a slightly tail-between-the-legs look
      even now. He had pushed his way by sheer instinct and sheerer effrontery
      on to the stage and to the front of it, with his plays. He had caught the
      public. And he had thought the kicking days were over. Alas, they weren't.
      . . They never would be. For he, in a sense, asked to be kicked. He pined
      to be where he didn't belong. . .among the English upper classes. And how
      they enjoyed the various kicks they got at him! And how he hated them!</p>
      <p>Nevertheless he travelled with his manservant and his very neat car,
      this Dublin mongrel.</p>
      <p>There was something about him that Connie liked. He didn't put on airs
      to himself, he had no illusions about himself. He talked to Clifford
      sensibly, briefly, practically, about all the things Clifford wanted to
      know. He didn't expand or let himself go. He knew he had been asked down
      to Wragby to be made use of, and like an old, shrewd, almost indifferent
      business man, or big-business man, he let himself be asked questions, and
      he answered with as little waste of feeling as possible.</p>
      <p>&quot;Money!&quot; he said. &quot;Money is a sort of instinct. It's a
      sort of property of nature in a man to make money. It's nothing you do.
      It's no trick you play. It's a sort of permanent accident of your own
      nature; once you start, you make money, and you go on; up to a point, I
      suppose.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;But you've got to begin,&quot; said Clifford.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, quite! You've got to get <i>in</i>. You can do nothing if you
      are kept outside. You've got to beat your way in. Once you've done that,
      you can't help it.&quot;</p>
