So she sat in the doorway of the hut in a dream, utterly unaware of
      time and of particular circumstances. She was so drifted away that he
      glanced up at her quickly, and saw the utterly still, waiting look on her
      face. To him it was a look of waiting. And a little thin tongue of fire
      suddenly flickered in his loins, at the root of his back, and he groaned
      in spirit. He dreaded with a repulsion almost of death, any further close
      human contact. He wished above all things she would go away, and leave him
      to his own privacy. He dreaded her will, her female will, and her modern
      female insistency. And above all he dreaded her cool, upper-class
      impudence of having her own way. For after all he was only a hired man. He
      hated her presence there.</p>
      <p>Connie came to herself with sudden uneasiness. She rose. The afternoon
      was turning to evening, yet she could not go away. She went over to the
      man, who stood up at attention, his worn face stiff and blank, his eyes
      watching her.</p>
      <p>&quot;It is so nice here, so restful,&quot; she said. &quot;I have
      never been here before.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I think I shall come and sit here sometimes.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you lock the hut when you're not here?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, your Ladyship.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you think I could have a key too, so that I could sit here
      sometimes? Are there two keys?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Not as Ah know on, ther' isna.'&quot;</p>
      <p>He had lapsed into the vernacular. Connie hesitated; he was putting up
      an opposition. Was it his hut, after all?</p>
      <p>&quot;Couldn't we get another key?&quot; she asked in her soft voice,
      that underneath had the ring of a woman determined to get her way.</p>
      <p>&quot;Another!&quot; he said, glancing at her with a flash of anger,
      touched with derision.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, a duplicate,&quot; she said, flushing.</p>
      <p>&quot;'Appen Sir Clifford 'ud know,&quot; he said, putting her off.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes!&quot; she said, &quot;he might have another. Otherwise we
      could have one made from the one you have. It would only take a day or so,
      I suppose. You could spare your key for so long.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah canna tell yer, m'Lady! Ah know nob'dy as ma'es keys round
      'ere.&quot;</p>
      <p>Connie suddenly flushed with anger.</p>
      <p>&quot;Very well!&quot; she said. &quot;I'll see to it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;All right, your Ladyship.&quot;</p>
      <p>Their eyes met. His had a cold, ugly look of dislike and contempt, and
      indifference to what would happen. Hers were hot with rebuff.</p>
      <p>But her heart sank, she saw how utterly he disliked her, when she went
      against him. And she saw him in a sort of desperation.</p>
      <p>&quot;Good afternoon!&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Afternoon, my Lady!&quot;---He saluted and turned abruptly away.
      She had wakened the sleeping dogs of old voracious anger in him, anger
      against the self-willed female. And he was powerless, powerless. He knew
      it!</p>
      <p>And she was angry against the self-willed male. A servant too! She
      walked sullenly home.</p>
      <p>She found Mrs. Bolton under the great beech-tree on the knoll, looking
      for her.</p>
      <p>&quot;I just wondered if you'd be coming, my Lady,&quot; the woman said
      brightly.</p>
      <p>&quot;Am I late?&quot; asked Connie.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh. . . only Sir Clifford was waiting for his tea.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Why didn't <i>you</i> make it then?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I don't think it's hardly my place. I don't think Sir
      Clifford would like it at all, my Lady.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't see why not,&quot; said Connie.</p>
      <p>She went indoors to Clifford's study, where the old brass kettle was
      simmering on the tray.</p>
      <p>&quot;Am I late, Clifford?&quot; she said, putting down the few flowers
      and taking up the tea-caddy, as she stood before the tray in her hat and
      scarf. &quot;I'm sorry! Why didn't you let Mrs. Bolton make the tea?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I didn't think of it,&quot; he said ironically. &quot;I don't
      quite see her presiding at the tea-table.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, there's nothing sacrosanct about a silver tea-pot,&quot; said
      Connie.</p>
      <p>He glanced up at her curiously.</p>
      <p>&quot;What did you do all afternoon?&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Walked and sat in a sheltered place. Do you know there are still
      berries on the big holly-tree?&quot;</p>
      <p>She took off her scarf, but not her hat, and sat down to make tea. The
      toast would certainly be leathery. She put the tea-cosy over the tea-pot,
      and rose to get a little glass for her violets. The poor flowers hung
      over, limp on their stalks.</p>
      <p>&quot;They'll revive again!&quot; she said, putting them before him in
      their glass for him to smell.</p>
      <p>&quot;Sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes,&quot; he quoted.</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't see a bit of connection with the actual violets,&quot;
      she said. &quot;The Elizabethans are rather upholstered.&quot;</p>
      <p>She poured him his tea.</p>
      <p>&quot;Do you think there is a second key to that little hut not far
      from John's Well, where the pheasants are reared?&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;There may be. Why?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I happened to find it today--and I'd never seen it before. I
      think it's a darling place. I could sit there sometimes, couldn't I?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Was Mellors there?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! That's how I found it: his hammering. He didn't seem to like
      my intruding at all. In fact he was almost rude when I asked about a
      second key.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;What did he say?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, nothing: just his manner; and he said he knew nothing about
      keys.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;There may be one in Father's study. Betts knows them all, they're
      all there. I'll get him to look.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh do!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;So Mellors was almost rude?&quot;</p>
