 <p>&quot;An' I'd tell 'em: Look! Look at Joe! He moves lovely! Look how he
      moves, alive and aware. He's beautiful! An' look at Jonah! He's clumsy,
      he's ugly, because he's niver willin' to rouse himself I'd tell 'em: Look!
      look at yourselves! one shoulder higher than t'other, legs twisted, feet
      all lumps! What have yer done ter yerselves, wi' the blasted work? Spoilt
      yerselves. No need to work that much. Take yer clothes off an' look at
      yourselves. Yer ought ter be alive an' beautiful, an' yer ugly an' half
      dead. So I'd tell 'em. An' I'd get my men to wear different clothes: appen
      close red trousers, bright red, an' little short white jackets. Why, if
      men had red, fine legs, that alone would change them in a month. They'd
      begin to be men again, to be men! An' the women could dress as they liked.
      Because if once the men walked with legs close bright scarlet, and
      buttocks nice and showing scarlet under a little white jacket: then the
      women 'ud begin to be women. It's because th' men <i>aren't</i> men, that
      th' women have to be.---An' in time pull down Tevershall and build a few
      beautiful buildings, that would hold us all. An' clean the country up
      again. An' not have many children, because the world is overcrowded.</p>
      <p>&quot;But I wouldn't preach to the men: only strip 'em an' say: Look at
      yourselves! That's workin' for money!--Hark at yourselves! That's working
      for money. You've been working for money! Look at Tevershall! It's
      horrible. That's because it was built while you was working for money.
      Look at your girls! They don't care about you, you don't care about them.
      It's because you've spent your time working an' caring for money. You
      can't talk nor move nor live, you can't properly be with a woman. You're
      not alive. Look at yourselves!&quot;</p>
      <p>There fell a complete silence. Connie was half listening, and threading
      in the hair at the root of his belly a few forget-me-nots that she had
      gathered on the way to the hut. Outside, the world had gone still, and a
      little icy.</p>
      <p>&quot;You've got four kinds of hair,&quot; she said to him. &quot;On
      your chest it's nearly black, and your hair isn't dark on your head: but
      your moustache is hard and dark red, and your hair here, your love-hair,
      is like a little brush of bright red-gold mistletoe. It's the loveliest of
      all!&quot;</p>
      <p>He looked down and saw the milky bits of forget-me-nots in the hair on
      his groin.</p>
      <p>&quot;Ay! That's where to put forget-me-nots, in the man-hair, or the
      maiden-hair. But don't you care about the future?&quot;</p>
      <p>She looked up at him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, I do, terribly!&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Because when I feel the human world is doomed, has doomed itself
      by its own mingy beastliness, then I feel the Colonies aren't far enough.
      The moon wouldn't be far enough, because even there you could look back
      and see the earth, dirty, beastly, unsavoury among all the stars: made
      foul by men. Then I feel I've swallowed gall, and it's eating my inside
      out, and nowhere's far enough away to get away. But when I get a turn, I
      forget it all again. Though it's a shame, what's been done to people these
      last hundred years: men turned into nothing but labour-insects, and all
      their manhood taken away, and all their real life. I'd wipe the machines
      off the face of the earth again, and end the industrial epoch absolutely,
      like a black mistake. But since I can't, an' nobody can, I'd better hold
      my peace, an' try an' live my own life: if I've got one to live, which I
      rather doubt.&quot;</p>
      <p>The thunder had ceased outside, but the rain which had abated, suddenly
      came striking down, with a last blench of lightning and mutter of
      departing storm. Connie was uneasy. He had talked so long now, and he was
      really talking to himself not to her. Despair seemed to come down on him
      completely, and she was feeling happy, she hated despair. She knew her
      leaving him, which he had only just realized inside himself had plunged
      him back into this mood. And she triumphed a little.</p>
      <p>She opened the door and looked at the straight heavy rain, like a steel
      curtain, and had a sudden desire to rush out into it, to rush away. She
      got up, and began swiftly pulling off her stockings, then her dress and
      underclothing, and he held his breath. Her pointed keen animal breasts
      tipped and stirred as she moved. She was ivory-coloured in the greenish
      light. She slipped on her rubber shoes again and ran out with a wild
      little laugh, holding up her breasts to the heavy rain and spreading her
      arms, and running blurred in the rain with the eurhythmic dance movements
      she had learned so long ago in Dresden. It was a strange pallid figure
      lifting and falling, bending so the rain beat and glistened on the full
      haunches, swaying up again and coming belly-forward through the rain, then
      stooping again so that only the full loins and buttocks were offered in a
      kind of homage towards him, repeating a wild obeisance.</p>
      <p>He laughed wryly, and threw off his clothes. It was too much. He jumped
      out, naked and white, with a little shiver, into the hard slanting rain.
      Flossie sprang before him with a frantic little bark. Connie, her hair all
      wet and sticking to her head, turned her hot face and saw him. Her blue
      eyes blazed with excitement as she turned and ran fast, with a strange
      charging movement, out of the clearing and down the path, the wet boughs
      whipping her. She ran, and he saw nothing but the round wet head, the wet
      back leaning forward in flight, the rounded buttocks twinkling: a
      wonderful cowering female nakedness in flight.</p>
      <p>She was nearly at the wide riding when he came up and flung his naked
      arm round her soft, naked-wet middle. She gave a shriek and straightened
      herself and the heap of her soft, chill flesh came up against his body. He
      pressed it all up against him, madly, the heap of soft, chilled female
      flesh that became quickly warm as flame, in contact. The rain streamed on
      them till they smoked. He gathered her lovely, heavy posteriors one in
      each hand and pressed them in towards him in a frenzy, quivering
      motionless in the rain. Then suddenly he tipped her up and fell with her
      on the path, in the roaring silence of the rain, and short and sharp, he
      took her, short and sharp and finished, like an animal.</p>
      <p>He got up in an instant, wiping the rain from his eyes.</p>
      <p>&quot;Come in,&quot; he said, and they started running back to the hut.
      He ran straight and swift: he didn't like the rain. But she came slower,
      gathering forget-me-nots and campion and bluebells, running a few steps
      and watching him fleeing away from her.</p>
