\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a snort Joe Hardy tumbled to the floor while his brother Frank stood over him, waving a folded umbrella.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Give up?" grinned Frank, poking at Joe's ribs.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a moment of silence.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No!" came the sudden answer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a bound the younger boy was back\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  on his feet brandishing a second umbrella. For a moment the fight was nip and tuck. Suddenly Joe's weapon found its mark. Down went Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Boys! Boys! What is going on here? Stop it this minute!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Her face white with alarm, Aunt Gertrude stood peering ov\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 er her glasses into the disordered living room. Frank pulled himself upright, rubbing his side. "Don't worry, Aunt

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Gertrude, we're just practicing," he reassured her.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Practicing?" snorted the boys' elderly relative. "Pract\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 icing how to kill yourselves. Gracious ! Just look at this room. Chairs turned over, your mother's clean rugs all mussed------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe went over and patted his father's sister on her shoulder. '' There, there, Aunt Gertrude, we'll fix everything up again. We \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
were just learning how to duel. You see, we 're going to be in a play and have to know the way to do it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Y}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 es, Chet Morton and his sister I}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ola want us to take part in a mystery play being put on for charity," Frank explained further, while Aunt Gertrude l\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ooked at them skeptically.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hmph. A play, indeed," she said indignantly. "What sort of play is it where two boys have to stick umbrellas into each other------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, we're going to use real swords in the play, Auntie," Joe interrupted mischievously. "Sharp \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ones, too. Golly, we'll--"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That will be quite enough," snapped the woman. "I'll have to speak to your father about it when he comes in. I'm sure he would not approve of his sons taking part in any dangerous duels."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a defiant shake of her head Aunt Ge\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rtrude flounced off, leaving the brothers convulsed with mirth.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm afraid she isn't going to help our acting career very much,'' Joe observed dryly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Mysterious Truck 3
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No, she'll probably be telling Dad about it any minute. I think I hear him coming\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  now.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Heavy footfalls sounded on the veranda. The door opened to admit a tall, handsome man with graying hair and keen blue eyes. He gave a start as he surveyed the scene in the living
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hmin. Has there been an earthquake?" he
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 queried.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hello, Dad!" both boys exclaimed in the same breath.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 An instant later they were exchanging sheepish grins and eyeing their parent uncertainly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We were just dueling, Dad," Frank offered finally. "Aunt Gertrude------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, with your mother away I can imag\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ine what Aunt Gertrude thinks of you," Mr. Hardy winked, waving a hand toward an overturned chair. "Well, come into the study, both of you. I have some interesting things to tell you.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The brothers needed no second invitation, for such a bidding from thei\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
r father, the famous detective, usually meant that adventure was in the offing. Fenton Hardy laid a bulging brief case on his desk and sank into his swivel chair.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hard assignment," he said, motioning toward the portfolio. "I think I have three of the crim\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
inals rounded up, but a fourth has eluded me thus far." He paused and looked out the window thoughtfully. "But that's not what I especially want to speak to you boys about."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 4 The Clue of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe sat on the edge of their chairs, thei\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 r eyes eager with anticipation. Mr. Hardy spoke.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I have reason to believe that one of the biggest groups in crime is operating under our very noses,'' he burst forth.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You mean right here in Bayport, Dad?" Joe exclaimed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy shook his head. "I'm not\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  certain they've reached Bayport yet, but they're in our vicinity, possibly as near as Aberdeen."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank looked at his brother. "Whew! That really sounds like something. What are they up to, anyhow?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Stealing is their principal occupation," replied the det\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ective grimly, "but they won't stop short of killing people who get in their way. Their scheme, boys, is about as clever and brazen a one as I've ever heard."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe squirmed expectantly as their father paused.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It seems that the ringleaders own a f\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 leet of motor trucks. Their plan is to have their drivers take these huge vehicles to wharves or railroad depots, and-----"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And steal merchandise being unloaded from ships and trains, I'll bet. Is that right, Dad?" Joe asked impatiently.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy could b\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 arely conceal a smile. "Your statement happens to hit the nail right on the head, son. That's just what they're do-
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Mysterious Truck 5
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The result is that thousands of dollars' worth of valuable goods are disappearing every
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 week."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank studied his fath\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 er's face hopefully. "Are you going to let us help you on the case,
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Dad!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His parent nodded. "I was coming to that, Frank. From the way things look I shall be busy for some time on a certain angle of the case. Meanwhile I wonder whether you boys might like\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 to follow one clue I have------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Will we! I'll say so," the younger lad exclaimed. '' Dad, you know we '11 do anything we can to help you.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy looked at his sons gravely. "Boys, I'm afraid these men we are after are extremely vicious. They'll \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
stop at nothing if they suspect you're trailing them. Don't take any unnecessary risks."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll be careful," Frank promised.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Very well. The freighter }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Nordic }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
is due to dock in the Aberdeen harbor tonight with a load of silver pieces for the Liberty \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Company. Some of these are very old and extremely valuable. I have reason to believe that the trucking thieves may attempt to steal this cargo. Your job will be to check up, see what happens, and then report to me."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Eagerly the brothers rushed upstairs to \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 pack. They decided to put on old overalls as a disguise but carry good clothes with them. After
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 6 The Clue of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 a parting word with their father they jumped into Frank's car and headed for the broad highway.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We ought to make it in an hour e\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 asily," Joe observed as they hummed along. "Look, there's the Old Mill Restaurant already. How about a bite of supper?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Twenty minutes later they were off again. Just as dusk was falling they entered the outskirts of the bay city of Aberdeen.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I hope we're\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  not too late to catch the ship, Frank."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We made good time and couldn't have reached here any sooner, Joe. Look, isn't that the harbor?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank nosed the car through a narrow, crowded street. Presently they found themselves at a huge wharf.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 No\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rdic," }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe whispered tensely. " It's just coming in. Boy, what luck!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A large cargo vessel was being warped into her berth by two snorting tugs. Their hearts pounding in suppressed excitement, the two Hardy boys made their way through the crowd of idle on\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
lookers, reaching the edge of the dock just as the ship came alongside.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If any of the band Dad mentioned are planning to steal the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Nordic's }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 freight, they should be arriving soon," Frank breathed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a loud clank of chains and a strain of hawsers as\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the vessel was made fast. Di-
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Mysterious Truck 7
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rectly opposite where the boys were standing, a large door swung open in the ship's side.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The cargo hold, Frank! Boy, isn't she loaded! Wonder if------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank clutched his brother's arm. Amid a deafeni\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ng roar a huge covered truck lumbered up, stopping beside them.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe that driver is one of the thieves," the boy said tensely.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' We '11 watch the fellow,'' replied his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where's the supercargo o' this ship?" demanded the driver, peering down at \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the boys. "I'm in a hurry. Got to haul away some valuable boxes without delay. The company don't want 'emstolen."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The brothers gazed at a name painted on the side of the truck. Liberty Company!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll try to find him for you," offered Frank. As the brother\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
s moved off, he whispered to Joe, "Guess we're on the wrong track. But we'll watch and be sure that the fellow doesn't pull any funny business."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Eight," agreed Joe, approaching a ship's officer who had just stepped off the gangplank and was carrying a she\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 af of papers in his hand.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Have you some boxes for the Liberty Company?" asked Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 By this time the truckman had approached and presented his credentials. Everything seemed to be in order, so the driver was given permission to load the boxes.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 8 The Clue\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You guys want to earn some money?" he asked, turning to the Hardys. "I want to get this stuff on as soon as possible."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Sure," said Frank. Then as the man went to unlock the back of the van, he whispered, "Even if we haven't caught any thieves, at least we can help this driver get away before any of the gang arrive."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Think I'll look over all the trucks here," suggested Jo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e. "Be back in a minute."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He found nothing suspicious, so returned to assist with the loading. In twenty minutes the task was accomplished, the Hardys paid, and the driver was off.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Our first assignment turned out to be a wild goose chase," sighed Frank, a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s the two boys walked to their car.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm afraid Dad will be disappointed," added his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They had gone barely half a mile along the highway out of Aberdeen when a pair of dazzling headlights bore down on them.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why doesn't that fellow watch where he's\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  going?" Frank exploded, veering toward one side.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a roar as the glare came closer. The boy began to toot his horn. He and his brother held their breaths.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He's going to hit us, Frank!" Joe shouted.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Just as a crash seemed imminent there was a scre\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ech of brakes. A large truck slithered to a stop not three feet from their car.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Mysterious Truck 9
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Frank! Look at the sign! It says'Liberty Company'!" Joe exclaimed excitedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The driver leaned out of his cab. '' Sorry to scare you," he yelled. "I'm i\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n a hurry. Got to meet a ship."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank eyed his brother significantly, then jumped from their car. He rushed over to the big vehicle, with Joe on his heels.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Did you say you were to meet a ship?" the elder lad inquired. "Was it by any chance the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Nordic? "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' She's in, all right,'' returned Frank. '' We just came from there, and helped to load one of your company's trucks."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What!" The man stared at them aghast. "Do\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  you mean you helped load a Liberty Company truck?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank nodded, his heart skipping a beat. The driver leaped out, his face distorted with rage and dismay.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Boys, there's only one Liberty Company truck that's supposed to meet the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Nordic, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

the truck driver showed his credentials to the boys. They included a letter of praise from the president of the company for long and efficient service. Sick at heart over their terrible mistake, the Hardys finally related the 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 whole story to the man.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, it ain't as if you helped that thief on purpose," said their listener. "Naturally you didn 't know what tha fellow was up to.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Just the same we should have been more cautious," Frank mourned. "After all, we're supposed to b\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e detectives. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man blinked at them. "Detectives! You boys detectives!" he cried.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank introduced himself and Joe. The man smiled broadly and held out a huge hand. '' Put 'er there, boys. I 'm mighty glad to know you,'' he said \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
heartily. "I've heard tell of your dad. I'm Tom Klip, best driver the Liberty Company-" He suddenly checked himself. "Guess }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank knit his brow. " I 'm wondering where 10

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 other driver got his credentials. Some printing plant must have done a good job of making out false bills of lading."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're right, Frank," his brother agreed. "Golly, if we could find the printer we'd have an important clue."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The older boy nodded. "Yes, and here's an idea, too."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For several moments Frank whispered with the others in the darkness. This was not the first \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
time the Hardy brothers had found themselves swiftly laying plans for the solution of some desperate crime.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As true sons of their famous father, one of the greatest detectives the country had ever known, Frank and Joe were rapidly achieving reputations of \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
their own. The first of their adventures was told in'' The Tower Treasure,'' wherein the boys helped their father find some stolen loot after a baffling search.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Their mother, Laura Mildred Hardy, and their Aunt Gertrude sometimes looked askance at the inte\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
rest the boys took in detective work, though inwardly they were proud of their youthful ability. Fenton Hardy, on the other hand, was openly delighted that his sons were following in his footsteps.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As in the present instance, Mr. Hardy many times had actua\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
lly turned over the task of solving a mystery to his sons when he himself was occupied with some other case. Though the solution of these riddles often led to great dan-

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ger, Frank and Joe never once had flinched in their at\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
tempts to clear them up. This had been shown in their latest adventure, which was a hunt for spies, in a story called '' The Mystery of the Flying Express.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As they now stood on the lonely road near Aberdeen, both brothers felt that they were about to emb\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ark on one of the most exciting cases of their young careers.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm afraid it's too late to do anything about the robbery, fellows," Tom Klip was saying with a pessimistic shake of his head. "You'll never be able to catch that other truck driver now. He's p

"He certainly will be gone if we don't get started after him right away," Frank said decisively. "Tom, suppose you go back to your company's headquarters and stay near a phone. We'll get in touch with you as soon as we find a clue."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, all \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 right, if you say so, but------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Before the truckman could finish, Frank and Joe had jumped into their car and turned it around. With a toot of their horn they sped back toward Aberdeen.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I've a hunch where we can pick up a clue," the older boy said betwee\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n set teeth. "We'll ask the gatekeeper at that railroad crossing near the wharf."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe looked thoughtful. "The joke will be on us if Tom Klip is the gangsters' driver and the other fellow turns out to be honest."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "His papers looked authentic," sai\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d Frank. "Anyhow, we'll find out for certain if we can catch the other fellow. Here we are.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank put on the brakes as they approached the lights of a grade crossing. '' I hope the gate-tender is still on duty-yes, there he is, Joe."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Stopping the car, he\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  jumped out with his brother right behind him. A grizzled old man standing by the track watched them curiously.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A truck? Sure, there's been plenty o' trucks passin' here this evenin'," he cackled in response to their questions.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But the one we're looking \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 for has Liberty Company painted on the sides," Frank pressed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The old man tapped his pipe. '' Liberty Company! Hm. There was a Liberty Company truck. Let's see, about half an hour ago, near as I can recollect. Crossed both ways.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's the one," Joe exc\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 laimed, trying not to show his excitement. "Which way did it go?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, let's see. I cain't remember for sar-tin', but I kind o' think he took that there left-hand fork. That road goes off to the mountains. Mind you, now, I cain't be sure------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a hasty word of thanks the boys hopped into the front seat and drove off in the direction the man had indicated. As the lights of Aberdeen were left behind, Joe's doubts began to mount.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How are we ever going to find one solitary truck 'way out here i\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n all this blackness?" he
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 14 The Clue of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 speculated dismally. "Look, there isn't even a house or a gasoline station where we could make any inquiries."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's no harm in our trying," replied his brother, though he too began to have misgi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 vings. "One thing's sure. That heavy truck can't go as fast as we can."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No, but it has a good head start. Say, what's up there ? Looks as if we 're going into some pretty deep woods," Joe exclaimed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The road was becoming narrower. A few moments later the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 brothers found themselves hemmed in by giant trees which swayed weirdly in the wind.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Golly, what a dismal place," Joe remarked. Suddenly he seized his brother's sleeve, saying, '' Frank! Isn 't that a light up ahead ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Instantly Frank jammed on the brake\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s and switched off both engine and head lamps. For several moments the boys strained their eyes and ears.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Are you sure you saw a light, Joe?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I thought I did. About a hundred yards ahead. There it is again.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was no mistaking the eerie glow filteri\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ng through the trees not far distant. As they watched, it vanished. A few seconds later it appeared again.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Come on, Joe, we'll investigate," Frank whispered tensely.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the light grew brighter. It seemed to glow from the deep woods some distance from the edge of the road. Frank in the lead halted and raised a Anger to his lips.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Sh!" he warned. '' Let's strike through the woods, Joe. The wind's making enough\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  noise to drown out sounds we make, but we'd better be careful anyhow."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Their first steps through the underbrush brought forth the loud snap of dry twigs; otherwise, there was no sound but the brushing of branch against branch.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Guess we're all right so fa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 r," Frank breathed. "Come on."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Gingerly they advanced, trying desperately to avoid stepping on twigs and branches in their path. The strange light wavered mysteriously somewhere ahead of them. Once it almost caught them directly in its rays.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'd better c\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rawl from here on," Frank whispered finally, dropping to the ground. : For some time they struggled through the dense thicket. Suddenly Frank whispered excitedly:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Look, Joe! There's the man we rre after!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He's painting out the Liberty Company letterin\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 g on the truck!" said his brother in a muffled tone.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Quivering with excitement, the boys watched the strange scene. Within a small clearing not fifty feet away the man could be seen standing on a ladder braced against the side of the van.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In one hand he held a powerful flashlight; in the other, a paint brush. Now and then he would pause to play the beam over the work he was doing.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He has just about finished," Joe murmured. "No, he's going after that other bucket of paint. Wh\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 at's he up to now ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll soon find out. Oh, he's moving his ladder to a new place. Look, it's red paint he's using this time. He's putting on another sign!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Now and then above the sighing of the wind the lads could hear the deep grunts of satisfaction as the man worked. The flashlight rays played about eerily as he swayed slightly at his task.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There goes a 'J,' " Joe whispered. "Now an 'O,' 'L,'-'Jolson,' it \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 says."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here comes another word. 'R,' 'A'------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' ' Radio,' '' finished Joe. '' Is that all ? No! There's the last word. 'Shop.' 'Jolson Radio Shop.' "
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Boy, if this isn't tracking down a thief I don't know what is!" Frank exulted under his breath. "Stil\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 l, we have to------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Look, he must be tired, Frank. He's lying down on the ground. Wonder if he'll go to sleep."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys watched tensely. The man had rolled up his coat to form a pillow and had stretched himself on the ground. Suddenly, to their dismay, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
the beam of his flashlight went out abruptly, plunging the place in darkness.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A Clue 17
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What shall we do, Frank?" Joe whispered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We must take that truck!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The driver may wake up."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll have to take that chance. Let's see how he came in here from the r\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oad. Did you bring your light?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here it is. We'd better hold off a while. He may not be asleep yet."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 After a little wait they could hear the telltale sounds of snoring coming through the deep gloom. Stealthily they crept into the clearing.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Stand in front\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  of the truck and snap on the flashlight ahead,'' said Frank under his breath. "Then the rays won't get in his eyes and wake him up."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The beam cut a swath of brilliance through the blackness. Instantly Joe snapped the light off again. Frank, who had been s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
tanding guard over the sleeping driver, joined him. "The truck is parked ready to start right off. There's a steep slope going down to the main road right in front of it," Joe informed his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good! That means we can let it roll before we start the e\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ngine. We ought to get away before that driver can wake up and intercept us.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Are we ready?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Together the boys listened with bated breaths. Monotonously the man's snoring continued. Frank touched his brother's sleeve.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "All ready, Joe!" he said almost sou\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ndlessly.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 there was a faint squeak as Frank stepped onto the running board of the big truck. The driver, snoring on the ground near-by, made no movement.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Go ahead!'' whispered Joe, gently nudging his brother. "The fellow's still asleep.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Gingerly the older boy crawled behind the wheel. As Joe walked ahead, playing his flashlight and motioning to his brother to proceed, Frank released the brake. The big truck began to roll. Down the crude wagon track Frank guided it for about two hundred 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 feet. Then Joe hopped inside, the headlights were turned on, and the speed was increased.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's that noise, Frank?" Joe asked his brother in sudden consternation.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 From somewhere through the trees ahead of them a loud rumble was growing rapidly in intensity.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's a train. The railroad tracks must be near here. That's great! The noise will drown out the sound of our motor.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the rumble increased to a roar, Frank t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hrew on the power. By the time the raucous

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Whew," whistled Joe, "between the train and us there was enough racket to wake up any sleeper. Wonder if the fellow \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 has missed the truck yet."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Presently Frank slowed his speed. "Here's the road we took. Our car isn't far away. Why don't you get it, find a policeman, and see if you can catch that driver? I'll take this load to the Liberty Company in Aberdeen."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Good en\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ough. I '11 meet you there as soon as lean. So long!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a wave of his hand Joe leaped to the ground and was off to the Hardy car. At top speed he headed for Aberdeen.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Pardon me, sir, but can you direct me to the police station?" he asked a bystander as\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  he entered the town.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Third block on your right," came the answer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Two minutes later he marched up the steps and confronted a sleepy desk sergeant.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's that, young man? You say you've located a criminal? Williams!" he called. A patrolman emerged from \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
an adjoining room. "Go along with this young fellow and check up on his yarn," snapped the sergeant. "Sounds like a fairy story to me."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The officer followed Joe to the latter rs car and the two sped off. The Hardy lad related

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And if he woke up and left, who's going to prove this isn't a lot of nonsense?" demanded the policeman.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  slowed the car as they approached the spot where he and Frank had parked previously. '' }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 I }

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardy boy began to have misgivings. Suppose the truck driver had awakened long before this and vanished? Nevertheless, Joe crawled on through a short cut with Officer Williams following.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly Joe stopped. "I think\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  I can make out the clearing up there ahead," he whispered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They listened. There was no sound. "If he's sleeping he certainly isn't snoring," Williams muttered dryly. "Better snap on your light and we'll have a look."

 to jam on the brakes to avoid crashing into a parked fire engine. The street was full of shouting firemen and squirming lengths of hose. Over the scene there hung a pall of smoke, with billows of solid flame spurting from the burning building.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Boy, that'\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s a real fire," Joe murmured, quivering with excitement. "Maybe we'd better give the firemen a hand. They need it.''

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At this instant came a splintering crash near him, followed by a loud yell. Joe squinted \bullet  through the smoke. The front of a large automobile was jutting through the display window of a small confectionery store!

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For an instant Joe hesitated. Should he race after the thief, or should he inv\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 estigate the present scene? Perhaps someone had just been hurt!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A glance through the shattered display window decided him. There was his brother in the very act of pursuing the fleeing Moe Gordon.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I guess Frank will get him all right," said Joe to himself\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 . '' Now let's see what's going on here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Mister! Eun fetch a police fellow! My shop, she is done for!" came a shrill voice close at hand.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the smoke and dust cleared gradually from the interior of the tiny shop Joe saw a small, beady-eyed man with a po\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 inted goatee beckoning to him from a corner of the room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Are you hurt?" the younger Hardy lad inquired, looking at the agitated fellow anxiously.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Is a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nyone hurt? I'm very sorry this happened," he said in a deep voice that wavered somewhat.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Pardon me, sir," Joe interrupted, "but is there \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 anything I can do for you? Are you in need of a doctor?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A little scratched but otherwise all right, thank you," replied the newcomer. "This is indeed an unfortunate occurrence. In trying to avoid colliding with a fire engine, I found myself forced off th

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I see you've had an accident," he drawled, eyeing a small, ferret-like individual who was stooping behind a counter.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Ah! It is Matty Storch. Wonder what he iffan\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ts?" he said half-aloud, going to the rear of the store and turning a key.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's about time you let me in, Charlie," came a whisper, as a slender young man with ugly features slipped inside. "I've been tap-|nng our code for ten minutes." v'r"0h, I'm sorry.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 I had a-a customer in the shop, Matty. Don't be mad. What's the trouble?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hardy? Fenton Hardy?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, Fenton Hardy, the detective! I saw Mm at the sta\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 tion ithis morning. Came in on the six-thirty train. Better watch out, Charlie. We don't want to get tangled with that fellow."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The shopkeeper's eyes popped. "What does he look like, Matty ? Is he big and tall ? Has he got gray hair ? Did he wear a gray ha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The ugly young man nodded vigorously. '"That's the fellow, all right. Why? Say, what's ailing you?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The young man was staring openmouthed at the distraught shopkeeper. "Say, what's this all about? Did you see Hardy? Tellme!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Hinchman suddenly stopped his pacing. "Listen, Matty. This morning I was standing here behind my counter. A ma\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n comes along and looks in the window------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Two blocks away in the Hotel Lenox another whispered conference was taking place.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's no doubt about Hinchman being in league with the trucking thieves," Fenton Hardy was saying to his sons. "And the candy \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 store, of course, is a cover-up."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He described his interview with the shopkeeper while the boys listened eagerly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think, though, that we'd better proceed carefully," the detective continued. "In the first place, the matter of damages should be settled b\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
etween Barker and Hinchman. With that out of the way our work will be easier."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then let's go right over and see Mr. Barker," Frank suggested. "He should be in his office now,"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Half an hour later they were seated around the desk of the distinguished-lookin\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
g executive. The boys had introduced their father and had informed Mr. Barker of their suspicions concerning Hinchman.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I certainly shall cooperate with you in
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Unwelcome Visitor 41
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 every way possible," said the man after hearing their story. "The truck\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ing thieves must be stopped at all costs, of course. I agree with you that, in the meantime, a damage settlement must be made with Hinchman as our first step.'' He pressed a buzzer and a young woman appeared. "Miss "Weed, please phone Mr. Hinchman and ask
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 him if he will be so kind as to come here this evening at eight. Tell him I shall dis--cuss payment for damages at that time."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The secretary disappeared. In the brief silence that followed Frank and Joe gazed wide-eyed at a veritable mass of relics on disp\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 lay in the room. Mr. Barker smiled.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, boys, those are pieces I've picked up here and there on my travels abroad. That vase came from Siam. That teakwood chair I bought in India. My special hobby is collecting swords, though. I have a great many of them

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What about this sheathed sword, Mr. Barker ?'' Joe asked, pointing to an old weapon hanging over the president's desk. '' Golly, it's a huge thing."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"That," said Mr. Barker, "is my pride and joy. It is a broadsword used by a Crusader during the Holy Wars in the Middle Ages. His name is engraved on the blade and the family coat-of-arms is on the hilt. I found the sword in a small out-of-the-way shop in
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Europe."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 42 The Clue of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At this moment the secretary returned. '' Mr. Hinchman says eight o 'clock will be all right,'' she said. '' He promised to be here on the dot.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy stood up. "In that event I think I shall do some other w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ork for the present and wait till I hear what is decided between yourself and the shopkeeper."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Very good, Mr. Hardy," returned the executive. "I'll have a chat with the man, offer him what I consider to be fair payment, and see how he acts. As soon as he \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
leaves I'll phone you. That should be about nine o 'clock.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As he noticed the boys again looking at the sword, Mr. Barker asked if they would like to see his collection of them right then. "I'm going home to a late luncheon," he said. "Suppose you come al
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ong and eat with me. Then I'll show you my treasures," he added.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe were delighted with the invitation. Mr. Hardy declined, but his sons accompanied the man to his car and rode toward his home. They found their host to be a delightful person, fu\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ll of interesting stories of the Crusaders and other ancient warriors.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You know," he smiled, "our own soldiers are a bit like the old knights who rode forth encased in armor. Only today the fiery steeds are engines and the armor is steel tanks!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In a few \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 minutes the boys found themselves driving through the gates of a beautiful estate. Large trees shaded a vine-covered brick mansion. The interior of the house was richly fur-

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "My fat\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
her also was a collector," said Mr. Barker in explanation. "Many of the things you see here belonged to him. He traced his , ancestry back many generations and enjoyed trying to find articles belonging to his forebears. We think the knight whose name is o
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the sword in my office was an ancestor of ours."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then that makes the weapon doubly valuable to you, doesn't it?" suggested Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes," agreed the owner. "I should hate to lose it or have anything happen to it.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Luncheon was announced by a butler. The \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
boys, who had had an early breakfast, were very hungry and greatly enjoyed the meal. Their host encouraged them to tell him of their adventures. Though modest about their exploits, the boys told enough for him to realize they were capable of undertaking t

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 If the boys had tried to guess ahead of time the number of pieces on display they would have failed by several hundred. When Mr. Barker opened a door to a large room, Frank and Joe were astounded. Before their eyes

were four walls covered solidly with every type of sword known to a collector. Some were several feet long, others only inches in length. Among them were both dull and shiny weapons, with wide or narrow blades, depending upon their use.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The hilts fascinated the boys. Several had coats-of-arms on them, others were plain with a holy cross embossed on the metal. A few were studded with jewels.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This exhibition is marvelous!" cried Joe. "It would take days to study these swords carefully."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Y\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ou're right," agreed Mr. Barker, "and I want you to come again some time. But before we leave, I must show you my most precious collection. It's in that cabinet in the corner."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He preceded Frank and Joe, opening the door to a high massive chest made of oak\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 . Within hung rows of short, exquisitely made weapons, all with precious stones embedded in the hilts.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I-I'm afraid I've been robbed!" Mr. Barker replied in a tone which implied he could not believe his own words.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the Hardy boys were shocked to hear Mr. Barker's words. They expressed their sympathy, then inquired what had been stolen.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A very valuable and unusual sword," the man answered. "It was used long ago by a matador in bullfights. He must have been a great fa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
vorite, for this estoque-that's the name of the matador's sword-is unusually attractive. It must have been presented to him by a very wealthy person; perhaps a king or queen.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why should anyone steal just that particular sword?" Joe asked. "Others here s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 urely are just as valuable."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I can't imagine why," said Mr. Barker. "Perhaps the thief planned to take more but was frightened away. This room hasn't been locked for some time, but from now on it will be!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He strode ahead of the boys into the hall and sum\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 moned the butler. After telling the man what had happened, he asked that the key to the museum be brought to him.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' No sir, "the butler replied. '' And I haven't been away from the house for a week," he added, leaving the room to get the key his employer wished.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe asked if there was anything they could do in regard to the mystery of the stolen estoque.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Thank you, no," said Mr. Barker. "I'll notify the police, but I presume that finding the weapon will be like hunting for a needle in a haystack. But maybe a good detective-why, I had forgotten entirely for the moment."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Forgotten what, Mr. Barker?" Joe in\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 quired.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That you boys have solved so many mysteries!" he smiled. "How would you like to find my estoque for me?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'd like nothing better!" cried Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Just give me a chance!" echoed Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 So it was settled that the police would not be notified until the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Hardy boys had had a chance to locate the valuable stolen weapon.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "May we stay here for a while this afternoon and start work?" Joe asked excitedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes indeed," replied Mr. Barker. "But don't begin by being suspicious of the servants. All of them have b\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 After the man had gone the boys started their investigation. After a two hour search they gave up. Not one p\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 iece of evidence had come *o light.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The thief certainly covered his tracks well," sighed Frank, discouraged. "I guess this case will be one to be solved by headwork rather than footwork."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe you're right," agreed his brother, "so let's start figuring \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the solution by guesswork. Idea Number One : maybe the estoque is in some pawnshop."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Idea Two: it may have been sold to a collector," offered Frank. "Or Number Three: >the weapon may have been stolen for some sinister use."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Like stabbing a bull?" grinned Joe.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Their father had not known of his sons' long absence, for he had been busy gathering some Useful data about valuable shipments of cargo. Upon meeting Frank an\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
d Joe he heard the story of the stolen matador 's sword with great interest. He thought it a most unusual theft.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I hope you find the estoque, boys," he said encouragingly. "And one little tip. Look among your bullfighters f\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 or the thief."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The eyes of the two young Hardys opened wide. They gazed at their father in admiration.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We never thought of that!" admitted Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There aren't any matadors in this country," groaned Joe. "We can't go skipping off to this land and that hun\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ting up bullfighters! What'11 we do?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective smiled. "Don't give up so easily," he counseled his sons. "You may get a clue unexpectedly. In the meantime, let's plug at this mystery of the cargo thieves, and more especially on Gordon and Hinchman."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 T\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he three Hardys discussed the day's events at the evening meal, but decided to draw no conclusions yet. They would await word of the outcome of the interview to be held at the Liberty Company.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Golly, I didn't realize it was this late," Joe exclaimed sudde\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nly, looking at his watch after dinner. "It's past eight-thirty already."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then we haven't long to wait to hear from Mr. Barker," said his brother with quickening pulse. "He will call us from his office most any time. Say, wasn't that a wonderful sword he \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
had hanging on the wall over his desk?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 \hich\f1 "I'd hate to get stuck with it," Joe laughed. '\'ab\loch\f1 There wouldn 't be much left of a fellow!''

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Excuse me, are you Mr. Hardy?" interrupted a voice close to the detective.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a significant look at his sons the detective arose and followed the boy to the telephone booth. A moment later he returned. The brothers sprang from their \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
chairs at sight of their father's expression.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We must move fast, boys," the detective said in a tense whisper. '' It was Miss Weed on the phone. She's very hysterical. Asked us to come to the factory at once."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What do you suppose has happened?" Joe queri\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed as all three dashed outside to the boys' car.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll know soon," said Frank grimly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The engine spurted into life and they started down the street.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Miss Weed didn't say so, but I fear Mr. Barker has met with an accident," Mr. Hardy remarked. "Look, isn'\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t that the Liberty Company straight ahead?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's an ambulance in front of it, Dad!" his younger son exclaimed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then came the wail of a siren. Just as Frank nosed their car to a stop along the curb the ambulance clamored past them. Jumping to the sidewa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There, there, try to calm yourself," said the detective gently. He took the girl by the arm. '' Come inside, Miss Weed, and let me get you a drink of water. Then perhaps you can tell us exactly what happened."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The young woman sank back into a chair, white\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  as a ghost. Joe went in search of a water cooler and reappeared a moment later with a paper cup in his hand.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Please, Miss Weed. What happened then ?'' Mr. Hardy urged gently.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I opened the office door and-and\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  there was Mr. Barker lying on the floor! The money I had come to get was gone, and the safe door stood wide open."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Were there any marks of violence on Mr. Barker?" Fenton Hardy asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I-I didn't see any, but-oh, I don't know," moaned\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the distraught woman. "I called the ambulance right away. Oh, dear, I shall never forget that terrible sight. Poor Mr. Barker!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy at length prevailed upon Miss Weed to return to her home. "We shall take care of the situation," the detective comfor\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ted her. "You go to bed and try not to worry. Everything, I'm sure, will come out all right."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a grateful look the young secretary left, whereupon Joe burst into an excited whisper. "Dad, the Crusader's sword is gone from where it was hanging over Mr. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Barker's desk!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here's part of it," came Frank's muffled voice from behind a large chair in a corner of the room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He bobbed up, displaying the hilt of the ancient weapon but only part of the blade.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Most of the blade is gone!" Joe cried. "See how shiny th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e jagged edge is? Now, who eto you suppose could have done that-and why!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At that moment there came a pounding at the entrance. Looking up with a start, Fenton Hardy crossed the room and yanked open the door. "Telegram, sir," piped a voice. "For Mr. Barker\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll take it," said the detective. "Here, boy." He flipped the messenger a coin, then shut the door and turned the key.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Are you going to read it, Dad?" Frank queried.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Under the circumstances I think we would be justifi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed in doing so," replied the boy's father. "Hmm. It's from Hinchman.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys looked at each other, mystified. '' I wouldn't trust that fell\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ow Hinchman as far as I can throw a stone," said Joe. "He's up to some mischief. There's no doubt about that."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' On the other hand, if he had anything to do with this attack on Mr. Barker, why would he have sent a telegram?" Frank speculated. "That sounds\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  as if-----"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Sounds as if he wanted to make it look as though he didn't know anything about what happened to Mr. Barker," his brother replied. "What do you think, Dad?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Any news?" Frank asked eagerly as his father finished speaking.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "None," announced the detective. "The hospital authorities refuse to give out any information except to say that Mr. Barker is in no condition to be questioned."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe returned to the room with a disappointing report. "I found the watchman in one of the oth\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 er buildings. He said he didn't know a thing about what had happened to Mr. Barker."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For several moments there was silence. Finally Mr. Hardy spoke. "Boys, I think you may as well go back to the hotel and get some sleep. I'll scout around and you can take \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
up where I leave off first thing in the morning."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 To his surprise the sun was streaming into the room. It was morning an\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d someone was knocking at the door. He jumped from bed and hurried to open it.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good morning, boys," boomed a hearty voice. "Time for work. It's nearly eight o'clock. Why, I've been all the way home to get my car."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you think Hinchman was speaking the truth ?'' asked Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's no telling.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  He may have spoken without thinking. He didn't know I was a detective when we were talking. Anyhow, we'll take that chance. Now, one more thing."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"Oh, he didn't leave till late last night. I watched them go. And Matty showed me an extra big roll of bills. Golly, I sure wish I could find out where Mr. Hardy is. I been lookin' for him all over town ever since breakfast."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank pulled his brother aside\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , his eyes glowing. "Say, Dad ought to know about this," he gaid. "Let's write him a note before we leave and let this boy take it over."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The wrecking car driver meanwhile had been looking at their machine. "If we can get a rope around her axle we'll be all right," he said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Sloshing around in\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There is a warehouse," the man replied. "About three miles from here. The government's got all sorts of stuff parked away there, I'm told. Got that cable fastened?" he called to Frank.

Once again the powerful wrecker started. With a loud groan and a splintering sound the huge, lightning-stricken tree was moved to the side of the road. Quickly the boys untied the cables, thanked the man for his help, and paid him for

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you know whether the government has trucks to haul away all its shipments that come in on the railroad ?'' asked Joe. " Or does some private company do itt"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys' task was a discouraging one. The first dock they approached was empty, an\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

 "Sit down, boys. I'm shocked over the disappearance of your father. Tell me, have you found any trace of him?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man gazed at the lad in mild surprise. "Why yes, I thought\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 the Crusader's sword hanging above my desk might serve as a weapon, should I need one. I removed it from its sheath and placed it on a little table. Then I noticed some money lying on Miss Weed's desk.'' He paused, and sipped some water from a tumbler. H

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Perhaps we had better leave," suggested Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I am still somewhat weak from the ordeal," Mr. Barker smiled gravely, "but I want you to hear this. I decided to put the money in the safe. Just as I started to open it, all the lights went out."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hinchman!" Joe exclaimed under his breath. '' Wow, that's luck for us!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If this isn't being hot\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  on the trail I don't know what is!" exulted Frank. "You remember he told Dad he had a moving business in Carside."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We must get into that building without being recognized. Question is, howl" responded his brother softly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Look, Joe! There is another Klon\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
dike Company van parked in the alley. That gives me an idea." Frank stole over, examined the truck carefully, then became excited. '' Look!'' he whispered. '' The name isn 't painted on; it's only on a board that's screwed to the side. Let's put the sign 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 o\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n our truck over the Liberty name and then drive in!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And unload those empty boxes we're carry* ing? It's a long shot but it might work if we're not asked too many questions," said Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Carefully the boys surveyed the scene and formed their daring plan. F\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ortunately the alley seemed to be deserted. They decided to drive the Liberty vehicle as close to the other as possible and then make a swift transfer of the sign. Rummaging around in the tool box, Joe drew forth a screw driver while Frank stood on guard.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Nobody in sight," he reported.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Keep watching. I'll have this thing off in half a minute."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a grinding sound as the lad pried loose the sign. "There it is, Frank. Just a second till I get the one on the other side\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Hurry up, Joe. Some men are coming down the walk."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A moment later his brother had both boards stowed safely in their truck. To their relief the passers-by paid no attention to them. After they had gone Joe attached the new name to the Liberty van.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Beady?" asked Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As Joe jumped aboard, he started the engine. Guiding the truck, he brought it to a stop at the entrance to the Great States Storage Company.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If anybody's watching us from the windows, we're done for," said Joe, gazing around dubiousl\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 y.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll have to take that chance. It'll be worth it if we can find Dad," Frank added, turning in.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Suppose they ask us for our consignment papers?" queried Joe, as a new fear came to his mind.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank thought fast. '' Guess he has,'' he said, forcing a heavy laugh.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Confound that Klondike Company!" exploded the man. "When are they goin' to \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 stop sendin' green drivers over here? Well, get busy."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys heaved sighs of relief. They were still safe! Together they began unloading the empty boxes from their truck. The burly man watched them a few moments, then disappeared. Frank nudged his broth

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Keep carrying in the stuff, Joe, while I take a look around,'' he told him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Wending his way through the gloomy, cluttered interior of the warehouse, Frank saw nothing of interest at first. Then his eye fell on a glass door thickly coated with dust.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n elevator!" he said, stepping alongside and pressing the button.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a loud clatter, then a prolonged bur-r-r as the lift eased down from somewhere

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hm. Four floors," he mused, inspecting a panel of buttons inside. "Well, I'll start at the gecond and work up."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He pressed the corresponding button and the automatic elevator slowly ascended in a series of squeaks and rumblings. At the second landing Fran\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 k stepped out.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Footsteps were approaching the elevator! The boy jumped back into the car and pressed the fourth floor button. He was just in the nick of time. As the car rose past the second floor level he saw two men signaling to him.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wow! That was a clo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 se one! They'll have to wait till I get off,'' he muttered in relief.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The car stopped at the fourth floor. Opening the door, Frank peered out, expecting at any moment to find himself in the clutches of some auspicious official. Instead, he saw nothing but \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
stacks of crates and boxes in the vast, silent' room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's that!" he suddenly asked himself. "Sounds like something scratching."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Every sense alert, he crept between two rows of boxes. Just then there was a loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 snap }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Ouch!" Frank's cry was automatic.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A second later he could have kicked himself for his lack of restraint. Gazing downward, he saw that his right shoe was caught in a powerful rat-trap. With a jerk he tore it free.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Again he heard the scratching sound. It was coming from a large box near an open window.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's strange!" thought the boy excitedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As he \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 was about to bound toward the case, there was a sudden clatter at one end of the room. Frank looked up with a start.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here comes someone," the boy groaned in dismay. "I'd better hide!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He stepped behind a high stack of crates just in time, for in a moment\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  three men marched down the very aisle where he had been standing.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're crazy, Storch, not goin' through Hardy's pockets before you brought him up," one of his companions snarled.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Oh, shut up!" snapped the other. '' What's the use o' goin' through hi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s pockets? He's in the carton, ain't he? He can't get out till we let him out, can he?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How do you know he can't? Some o' these detectives are regular Houdinis. They can get out of anything."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "All right, look for yourself and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 see }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid12651623

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank's h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 eart was thumping so hard he was afraid the men would hear it! At that instant there was a series of loud clangs.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's the bell!" shouted Storch.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For a long second silence prevailed. Then me the muffled response, "Hurry!" The boy looked around for a tool. Spying an metal file lying on the floor, he set to work 9H the carton. In half a minute Mr. Hardy was ffree.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 gathering gloom from one end of the room to the other. In a jiffy he was back.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Supporting the detective as best he could Frank hurried him along the murky aisle.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll-m-make it, F-Frank!" gasped his weakened father.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It seemed an eternity before the H\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ardys had passed the danger zone and reached the fire escape exit. The rumble of the lift suddenly ceased. In a babble of gruff voices several men stepped out. Frank gripped his father's arm and the Hardys froze in their tracks.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where is he?" piped the fa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 miliar voice of Hinchman.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Over there in that big crate, Charlie," snapped another. "Hank, where's the light? First thing you know we'll be steppin' in the rat-traps."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank's heart was in his throat as an overhead bulb was snapped on. But he sighed in rel\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ief as the men moved in the direction of the broken carton.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With scarcely a sound the Hardys slipped through the fire escape door. Gulping in the fresh air, they picked their way cautiously down the winding steps.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Keep your eyes open, Frank. We still may \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 be seen," murmured Mr. Hardy.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good idea. T\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 here's a dark doorway right [\\over there. That'll serve the purpose."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Pretend you're a cripple, Frank," Mr. |;Hardy whispered. "Leave the rest to me."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the man approached the wildly barking dog, he halted. Just emerging from the door-; Way was a lame boy leaning on the arm of an [ felderly companion in overalls.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's goin' on here?" demanded the new-mer after he had regarded them momentarily. "Did t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he dog bite the young feller?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The other made an unpleasant grimace. "Guess you ain't the fellers I'm lookin' for. Get along with you! We're not needin' hired help."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He glared afte\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 r the two as they walked slowly down the street and disappeared around a corner. Seeing no one about, Frank uttered a cry of joy. "Golly, Dad, that was great acting!

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy's face looked grim. ''Where did you leave Joe? Didn't he come with you?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, Dad. I left him at the loading plat, form."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank gazed toward the building.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  "Our truck is gone! Joe must have taken it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then he probably is safe. Now, we-" The detective stopped and wavered slightly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Dad! Are you ill?" Frank reached out just in time to keep his father from collapsing on the pavement. "Golly, I'd almost forgott\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
For a quarter of an hour father and son proceeded as rapidly as Mr. Hardy's depleted strength would permit. At length they found themselves in a better section of town. With a choice of restaurants on the main street Frank chose a Spanish one called "El
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Matador."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That sounds interesting," he said, wondering if by any chance a former matador might run the place. "Let's go in there and get some nourishment," he urged.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
During the meal it became evident that the manager suspected that the Hardys were in disguise and he tried hard to find out who they were. The detective and his son gave the man no inkling of their identity, but turned the conversation to the subject of s

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 This bit of information startled Frank. Recalling the words of the antique dealer, Mr. Panser, about the man who h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

and laugh-jly suggested that he let them out a side door, the street, their troubles began again. 'We'd better take a taii and go to the sta-on," suggested Mr. Hardy. "I'm sure Joe auld be most apt to wait for us there. If he x't there, we'll take a train

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, it'\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s I," grinned Joe, who seemed to have appeared from nowhere. "Hello, Dad, I'm certainly glad to see you. We'd better not stay around here. Follow me."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Pleased and relieved, Fenton Hardy walked rapidly after his two excited sons. Joe led the way to the rear\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  of the depot, then halted and peered around furtively.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We're not safe anywhere in this city," he whispered. "Gordon, Hinchman and the rest are after us, I'm certain of that. They think we know too much 1''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "From their point of view, I guess we do," smile\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d the detective. "I wish we had more evidence. An arrest now wouldn't prove much."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I've hidden our truck in a barn outside of town and taken off the Klondike signs. I think we ought to get out there right away. We'll have to take a taxi-" he looked at his\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 father- "but we'd better be careful which one."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wait here and I'll get a cab," said Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He slipped away and watched a line of cars alongside the station. Satisfied at last that no suspicious-looking characters were driving them he summoned one. In a j\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
iffy he had signaled to Joe and Mr. Hardy and all three got in.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Number 38 Grove Pike," ordered Joe in a low voice, and the cab chugged off.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank gazed at his brother expectantly. "What happened after I left you, Joe? Did they catch you with the boxes ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The younger lad made a wry face. "Pretty

jrly, but not quite," he whispered. "I went i unloading them after you left. All of a sud-Jen, just as I had finished, Hinchman came Idown to the platform. He didn't recognize me, he wanted to know what our truck had brought."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank leaned toward his broth\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 er eagerly. ""What did you do then?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe chuckled. "I said I was just a hired *4river and didn't know anything about what I ' had carried. He asked me a lot more questions nd I pretended I didn't know anything. Then suggested he go inside and take a look a

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Did he?" Mr. Hardy queried. "Yes. Then I thought I better skip! I iped into the truck and got away as fast as could."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good work," said the detective. "Another ||wo minutes and you'd have been caught."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't I know it? Well, I had a hunch\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 that |if Frank had found you, Dad, you probably fwould decide to take a train to Aberdeen. Any-plow, I took that chance and here we all are! ^Driver, here's the place,'' he said, and they drew , Up in front of a rambling farmhouse.

 Joe whispered as he led [,the others to the rear of the building and into barn. "Here's the truck. Apparently it .been touched. I piled hay in the back. )ad, you and Frank had better hide in it till ! get to Aberdeen."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Le\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t's you and I change clothes first, Frank," suggested Mr. Hardy. "After all, I'm bigger than you, and these clothes of yours are pretty snug,'' he laughed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The exchange was made. A few minutes later the huge truck was on the highway, humming along at a ste\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ady pace. Mr. Hardy and Frank, snugly ensconced in the pile of hay in the rear, talked over plans for their next move.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think I'll phone the Carside police and have them keep an eye on Hinchman's warehouse, '' said the detective. '' They may be able to f\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 urnish us with valuable evidence.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Very weary from his recent experiences, Mr. Hardy presently fell asleep. The next thing he knew his younger son was opening the back door and saying:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "All out! Aberdeen! We're a block from the hotel. Better get out here \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 and walk. I think we ought not to drive over to the entrance. Somebody may be watching."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How about you going to the hotel, Dad?" suggested Frank, "and Joe and I returning Mr. Barker's truck?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The plan was agreeable to the detective, so the boys set forth \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 immediately. Leaving the vehicle at the Liberty Company, they took their car and stopped at the executive's residence.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What, back so soon?" greeted the man affably from a wheel chair. "I thought you'd be gone for days. Tell me, have you heard anything fro\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 m your------"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys related their story and told of the
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 spicious activities of Hinchman. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When they finished, Mr. Barker promised them any further assistance he might be able to give.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We have a clue to the identity of a matador |,named Castillo, now in this country," said ijPrank. "Putting two and two together, we [think a matador may have you\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 \hich\f1 r stolen estoque, i

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good," smiled Mr. Barker. "It seems to |iae you Hardys have several big tasks to ac-I0omplish."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The hardest one to figure out is the broken liword in your office," said Joe. "Why didn't jit\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he intruder take the hilt I That is the valuable fpart."

"But the blade is the weapon," offered Mr. iBarker. "Oh, I keep hoping that whoever has lit isn't using it for some sinister purpose. I | shiver every time I think it might have been i used on me. Maybe it was fortunate I was un-\'bb\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe wheeled the man in and \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the boys looked 1 at a colored picture of a small, beautiful weapon, ; richly studded with jewels. The Hardys were

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 not likely to mistake the original, should they find it.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's a coincidence that we have come across two my\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
steries about swords so recently," said Joe. "Just before leaving home my brother and I were practicing a fencing act for a show we are going to be in."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Chet Morton, a friend of ours back home," Frank explained further, "is chairman of a play to be given \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 for charity. In it Joe and I are supposed to fight a duel with swords."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Up to the present we've used umbrellas for weapons," laughed Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Without a word Mr. Barker smilingly reached up and unhooked two swords from the wall. "If these will be of any help t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
o you in your play, I'll lend them to you gladly. Here you are," he offered with a smile.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, Mr. Barker, do you really mean it?" Joe gasped, his eyes shining.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank likewise was excited over the unexpected offer. "We'll be }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 very }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Be very careful not to kill each other with them," said the elderly man with a twinkle in his eyes. "The blades are sharp, as you will notice. I wish you all manner of success with your play!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Thanking the gentleman, the boys departed, th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 en headed for the Lenox Hotel.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You know," said Frank when their elation over receiving the swords had abated some-

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If we go marching in there with these two eapons we'll probably be \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 asked to check out!" jughed Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I hate to leave them in the car all night," lid Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If Gordon or Hinchman should be spying us at the Lenox, they would love to get their fbands on them," added his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We might hide the swords under that fWanket \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
in the back there," suggested Frank, ]*.*and leave the car locked in a garage a few locks away. We can walk from there." This plan was carried out. Upon reaching |the hotel, the boys went directly to their father's \bullet 
room. He was in bed but not asleep.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Afte\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
r hearing about the swords, he gasped , and warned the boys to be mighty careful of them. They promised, then told him of their , Mea of checking out of the hotel in the morning. "We'll do it," he agreed. "And now we all must get some sleep. But before yo

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the morning the two brothers got their
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 automobile. They had just put their bags in
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the back of it, when their father came toward

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the three Hardys trailed the man in the boys' car they discussed the probable truth of his statements.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It may be a trick," muttered Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, we have two swords with us in case of trouble," Joe chuckled.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll have to be wary," cautioned their fat\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 her.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For some time the Hardys followed the man through outlying districts until they found themselves on a narrow road in a tangled wilderness.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I can't say I like the looks of this place," said Joe apprehensively. "What's that fellow up to, anyhow!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'l\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 l soon find out," observed Frank. "He's stopping. He's waving to us."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He wants us to get out of the car and follow him on foot. Shall we go?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Certainly," broke in Mr. Hardy. "But watch out."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Dad, the walking is dreadful," said Frank. "Won't you please w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ait in the car? But lock yourself in. We don't want you to disappear again!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy, feeling not too strong yet, agreed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Come on, Joe!" urged Frank.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For several moments the lads floundered | about among water-soaked reeds, stumbling through boggy sand that came at times above ' their knees.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This is a trap of some sort, you j\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ust wait and see," Joe declared under his breath. "We were fools to fall into it so easily."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The group plodded on. The stranger uttered Hot a word. Joe was growing more and more impatient. He hurried up behind the tanned young man.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The fellow shaded his eyes and squinted through some dense reeds. Then he turned to Joe with a broad smile. "See it?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You see, I was telling you the truth," the young man said in a pleasant voice. '' I chanced to see the automobile early this morni\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ng while I was fishing. I looked inside and saw the name Fenton Hardy on an envelope in the dashboard pocket. I telephoned your home and found out you were at the Lenox."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That was mighty fine of you," said Joe, ashamed of his suspicions. His brother echoe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d his sentiments.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank was staring at the vehicle. "Golly, look at it. Must be down to the hubs in the sand. How do you suppose it ever got to this place?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Auto thieves sometimes get scared after they take a car," offered the fisherman, and the boys did \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 not enlighten him on the real truth.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll miss my guess if we don't have a bad time getting it out of those ruts," said Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys inspected the mired vehicle, which appeared undamaged. Frank stepped on the starter and the engine roared into life, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 but the car failed to budge.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We must have planks," suggested the stranger. "I believe I can get some from my boat at the beach."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys accompanied the obliging man a few dozen yards distant to a place where they came upon a dory on the sand.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The scheme worked admirably. Frank sat ; at the wheel and as soon as the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
car was on dry ground the other two jumped in. After a short, rough ride they turned into the lane where the ' waiting cars were parked. Fenton Hardy hailed .them delightedly and chatted for several moments with the stranger, whose name was Henry \bullet

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Just an ordinary truck, so far as I can see," observed Joe, scrutinizing the scene. "Can't say I lik\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e the looks of the driver, though."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That is exactly what I was thinking," murmured Mr. Hardy. "Frank, see if you can find out anything about him without too much fuss."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boy strolled outside. As Joe and his father watched, they could see Frank casually\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 talking first with the driver, then with the attendant. As the truck departed, Frank hurried back to his companions.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Once outside, the lads hesitated. "Where do you suppose we'll ever find Dad, Frank?" speculated his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's call the garage. There's\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  a chance he may be there still."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy was located at the place. He was astounded and delighted at the news.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Without further ado the three departed, Frank an\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As they came near the warehouse again, Frank slowed do\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 wn to look at the huge structure of the Great States Storage Company. At the same instant came the sound of a terrific explosion.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Golly, the whole thing's c\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 aving in!" Joe gasped. "How do you suppose it happened?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Wonder if anybody was hurt. Let's investigate," Frank suggested as a shower of plaster dust arose above the tumbling, bricks. "It might be a good time to look at the company's records, too. Let's 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 see if we can find any of them. They 'd be valuable evidence.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Tensely the brothers waited until the toppled structure had settled. Then, coughing and sneezing, they hurried through the haze that hung over the street. Finally they approached the spot wher\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e the entrance to the warehouse had been.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The office was about there, Frank, under that pile of wreckage."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys crawled up on t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 op of the debris and peered through the chinks and cracks.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The words were scarcely out of his mouth ! when there was a loud rat-tat-tat and a hail of ! loose plaster cascaded over them. The boys ducked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, for a helmet," the younger lad wailed after the sound had subsided.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I could use a whole suit of armor,"\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  laughed his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Say, hand me your flashlight a minute." Frank poked the instrument through a large crevice in the pile of debris. "It's the office, Joe! Hardly scratched! Look!'' \bullet 
 Intently they gazed at the fairly intact room beneath the wreckage. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank swung the light to and fro. "There's the office safe, Joe!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, and look at it. The door's ajar." . "I suppose the explosion or whatever it was blew it open. Stay here and hold the light. I 'm going down to get a closer view."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe played the light \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
over the room as his brother climbed gingerly through the loose boards and plaster. He began poking about. Presently he stepped into the open again, his face registering keen disappointment.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' The safe's empty,'' Frank announced. '' So are the desk drawer\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s. There's nothing down there except that stack of boxes you can see in the corner."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Looked like a lot of junk to me. Old tools saws, files, some coils of wire. Nothing very valuable."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For several moments neither of the boys spoke as they watched a fast gathering crowd of people. Then Joe cried out, "Why didn't I think of that before ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Think of what?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Remember the speeding car we chased!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'11 say I do."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll bet Hinchman and his c\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ronies were in it, making a quick getaway with all their records and valuables."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank Hardy knit his brow thoughtfully. Then he nodded.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's perfectly possible. They decided the trail was too hot, so they set a time bomb to destroy whatever evidence they\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  couldn't carry with them.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Exactly, Frank. Come on, let's find Dad. He's probably at the police station."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The wail of sirens interrupted them, and a moment later several police cars came to a stop. Shouts filled the air.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's Dad!" Joe exclaimed, sp\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ying the familiar figure of their father accompanying the omcers.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys hurried over to the detective, who greeted them with a frown. "Boys, it looks as if they've outsmarted us. I was hoping we could snare the gang before they might guess what we were \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
up to."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Hunting in the Wreckage 137
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys drew aside and watched the eerie play of lights and the scrambling figures of the policemen. The boys related how they had investigated the buried office, but had found nothing of importance.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm not surprise\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
d at that," muttered their father. "And that's not the worst of it, either. I went to the police station expecting some news after their message and found that they merely wanted to ask me a few more questions about Hinchman."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you mean that the authori\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ties haven't discovered a single thing after all their watching, Dad?" Frank queried, unbelieving.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy shook his head in disgust. "Not an iota, although they say they've had a special man watch the warehouse day and night for a week." The detective's\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 voice sank to a whisper. "I've a feeling that someone on the police force is in cahoots with Hinchman, boys."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I wonder if they moved out all the stuff," said Joe. "If so, it will be pretty conclusive proof that they blew up the place on purpose. Let's se\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e what we can find out."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Again the boys scrambled about the wreckage after obtaining police permission to do so. Although they searched as thoroughly as possible in the ruins, they could find no remnants of crates, boxes or any of the contents the cartons 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 might have held.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The next thing to do is to inquire of people working in the vicinity whether they noticed a

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 lot of stuff being moved out within the past day or so," said Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Between them the brothers interviewed a supe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
rintendent of a brick yard, the proprietor of a quick lunch stand, and several other persons. No one had noticed any particularly heavy movement of trucks.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Guess we're licked," decided the older boy at last, hot and weary.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe, not as apt to become discou\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 raged as Frank, said suddenly, "The stuff had to be taken away somehow. There's a river down there. Maybe a boat was loaded with Hinch-man's stolen stuff."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But somebody would have seen it being taken out," objected Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not if it was carried away under\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ground."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Underground! You mean a tunnel I'' asked Frank excitedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Exactly," replied Joe. "It may be a wild guess, but I'd like to do some hunting."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "One thing's certain," said Frank. "We can't look under the debris for an entrance to a tunnel. We'll have to look down by the river for the exit."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Drawing an imaginary line from the wrecked warehouse to the river, the brothers hastened with all possible s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
peed toward the water. It was a moonless night, so both boys made sure they had their flashlights.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Carefully they picked their way down the embankment, then the brothers separated, one

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think we ought to look there," he said when Joe reached him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He pointed his light. At the same time the heavy door swung outward\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  and a furtive face appeared. At once it disappeared again.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's get closer," whispered Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Cautiously the two boys reached the spot and climbed to the ground above the door. Again it opened.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I guess it's all right now," said a voice. *'Got that reco\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rd book of Hinchman's?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Together the two started down the embankment. At the same instant the boys jumped from their perch.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll take the one ahead!" cried\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Frank, racing after the figure that in fright had leaped forward.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't know anything, honest I don't," he whined. "All I know is the warehouse gang has been takin' stuff in boxes out of the tunnel and puttin' it on boats."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where did they take it?" demanded the sergeant.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The prisoner shrugged. "I don't know. I didn't help 'em. I just watched 'em. I didn't do anything wrong, honest!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Dawn had hardly brightened the eastern sky when Frank and Joe were stumbling through the ruins of the warehouse again. After they had slipped and slid for two hours their search still had revealed nothing. They had just decided to
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  go off for some breakfast, when Joe's foot suddenly kicked something sharp beneath a chunk of plaster. He bent low and picked it up.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Look at this!" he cried. "It's part of a sword blade!" In his hand he held a piece of metal about four inches long. Turni\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 \hich\f1 ng it over, he saw engraved the letters\'ab\loch\f1 
' CELOT." " What was the name on the Crusader's sword!" he added excitedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Edouard Poincelot," replied Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then here is a piece of Mr. Barker's broken sword!" exclaimed his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Thrilled, Frank examined the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 fragment of steel. "It's part of the missing blade, sure as you're alive!" he agreed. "That definitely links Hinchman and his pals with the theft and accident in Mr. Barker's office."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Eagerly the brothers renewed their search but no other piece of the metal came to light. At last they decided to give up the hunt.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No doubt the person who was holding the blade when this piece we've just found snapped \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 off still has it," said Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's hope so," added Joe. "I'd like to return every part of Edouard Poincelot's sword to Mr. Barker."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And catch the thief on two counts," said Frank. "Well, let's get started. Where do you suggest we begin?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 at joe's suggestion the Hardy boys decided to look along the water for the book of records tossed away by the stranger coming from the tunnel the night before.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Suppose you fish around in the water,"\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  said Joe, "while I investigate the tunnel. May find something interesting there."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank fumbled in the muddy water for a while without success. Discouraged, he ambled downstream, gazing about him idly. Suddenly he stopped, peered ahead into a clump of ree\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ds at the water's edge, then waded out to a drifting rowboat.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If that book on the back seat is the one we want, then we're in luck," the boy said to himself excitedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Beaching the moving craft, he picked up the large, black-covered volume. It was marked \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Ledger." Frank shouted for his brother as he splashed back to dry ground.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's up?" cried Joe, joining him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I've found the book of records of the Great States Storage Company," his brother cried. "Some evidence!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hurrah!" said Joe, thumping the other on the back. "Let me see it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 144 The Clue of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Quickly the two thumbed through the volume, growing more excited with each revealing page. It was clear that they now possessed evidence which would insur\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But we still haven't caught the crooks," Frank remarked with a dry chuckle. "What good is the evidence without the men responsible for it!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not much, I guess," his brother admitted. "Well, let's get back to the h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 otel and tell Dad what we've found."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy suggested that he and his sons return to Bayport to study the contents of the ledger and formulate fresh plans for trapping the lawless men. As they drove up to the Hardy house on Elm Street some time later, t

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's about time you fellows came back," he snorted in mock rage. "I was just asking your Aunt Gertrude where you were. How do you suppose I can manage a play if half the actors are missing!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank winked\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  at his brother. "We've been getting some stage props, Chet," he grinned, reaching under the car seat and bringing forth the two swords Mr. Barker had lent him and his brother.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The stout boy gulped. "G-good night, where'd you get those wicked-looking thing\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We're having one this evening. That's I came over for. Your aunt invited me to pdinner. We'll go right afterward."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you m-mean to say that those things can snap off?" he stammered, leaning\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  away from the weapons Joe was holding.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, the one that was hanging in Mr. Barker's office did, but these two are all right -so far," said the Hardy lad in mock gravity. "Of course, you never can tell what will happen when we start dueling."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet gazed\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  at the weapons fearfully. "Well, all I can say is I'm glad }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 I'm }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a series of loud clanks as the swords clashed. The boys soon found themselves surrounded by the other members of the cast.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The milling group scattered, and not a second too soon. Only a plump, slow-moving figure was left in the center of the stage.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Ouch! I'm killed!" cried Chet a second later.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Convulsed with laughter, Frank and Joe went to their chum's assistance, pulling asi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 de a "garden wall" which had dropped from its ropes overhead.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You know what I want, Fenton Hardy. Where's that book of records belonging to the Great States Company? Come on, speak up. Where is it?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 T\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he detective said nothing. He felt the grip on his throat tighten.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where's that ledger!" roared the man as the captive struggled to get his breath.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Whirling spots danced before Mr. Hardy's eyes. Then, just as he felt himself lapsing into unconsciousness, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
the hand around his neck loosened abruptly. Dimly the detective was aware of a newcomer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I've got him, Mr. Hardy," exclaimed a familiar voice.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a dull thud, followed by sounds of a struggle. Then came a shout, and the patter of running footsteps.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He got away," groaned the familiar voice.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective pulled himself up with an effort. '' Oh, it's you, Smalley.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, sir. I thought I had him. Hit him over the head with a blackjack, but when I turned around to look at you he jumped up and ran off\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy mopped his brow. "Well,

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy, who had gone to answer the telephone, came into the room just then. "Boys, I have received a call from the Justice Department in Washington. They want me there right away to confer

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Promising that they would do their best, the brothers drove their father to the airport where the detective departed on an express plane. On the way home Frank bought a \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 newspaper.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You'd better come along to the station house, Captain," ordered the policeman when Joe reported his findings. "Sounds like somet\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hing phony goin' on."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Despite the angry protests of the schooner's officer he was led off, while the parachute company driver thanked Joe.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys laughed, said they were glad to have been of help, and returned home.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hello, what's this?" exclaimed Frank as the boys walked into their living room. "Hm. Letter from Mr. Webster."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe it's good news about Narvey," replied Joe. "Hurry up and\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  open it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His brother did so, and unruffled a large sheet of paper covered with sprawling letters.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not much good news," was his answer. '' Mr. Webster says his son, who is worse, keeps referring to Moe Gordon. Narvey's father says he '11 give us a huge r\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
eward if we can catch the crook, because he thinks the young man never will be cured until that fellow is behind bars."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe regarded his brother thoughtfully. "A lot of people will be better off, Frank, if we can catch Gordon-and Hinchman-and Storch, too."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "While we're waiting to hear further orders from Dad, why don't we concentrate on circuses ?'' suggested his brother. "I'd like to follow up Chet's clue to the stolen estoque."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I should, too," said Joe. "Oh, good, there goes the dinner bell. We'd better \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 wash ourselves and comb our hair before Aunt Gertrude sees us," he laughed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A few minutes later the three sat down to a delicious soup course.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm glad you're here," sighed Aunt Ger-

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm glad we're here, too," said Joe. A few minutes later he exclaimed, "Aunt Gertrude, this is the best soup I've ever tasted."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The old lady be\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 amed. Apparently she had either forgotten about the sword episode or else had forgiven her nephews for scaring her.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You boys must be hungry after all your running around. I do wish you would stay at home more. Some day something dreadful will -" she began.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank jumped to answer the ringing telephone. After a considerable interval he returned, winked at Joe but continued eating. When the meal was over he drew his brother into their father's study.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That was Dad, Joe. He wants us to meet him tomorrow aftern\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oon at a circus being held at Summit. Says he has important news."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't know. But maybe we'll find the matador Castillo and the stolen estoque, too, while we're doing a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  job for Dad."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe grinned. "Aunt Gertrude will he hurt if we leave her this evening."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're right," agreed his brother. "Let's play some game with her-we'll let her choose it-and then we'll start off about four in the morning.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
The old lady bubbled over with delight, and later, after a great deal of fun, said she had not | had such a good time in months. The boys got off promptly at a very early hour and set out for High Point. By nine o'clock they were standing on the front por

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Come in, gentlemen," greeted a jovial-looking Negro butler, opening the door just then.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When the elderly millionaire came to shake hands with the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 boys, they were shocked at the look on his face. He appeared very worried and unhappy.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm so glad you are here," he said in a quavering voice. "Narvey is-is worse. The specialist holds out no hope for his mind being restored. It is breaking my heart."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "M\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ay we see him?" Frank asked kindly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Certainly, boys, I am eager that you should. He keeps muttering the name of Moe Gordon

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe nodded. "We are doing everything p0s. sible to catch him, Mr. Webster."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Webster smiled faintly. "I am glad. Only I hope you succeed in time. I am confident that if Gordon is imprisoned my boy will recover. Come upstairs. We shall visit hi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 m."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys followed the man up a long, winding staircase and down a hall.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here is his room. Go right in."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank's heart skipped a beat as he pushed open the door. There, huddled on the bed, was a figure which was the very picture of despair.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Narvey!"\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Frank called softly. "Narvey, we're Frank and Joe Hardy!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For a long moment the young man remained motionless. Then, very slowly, he turned toward them.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Narvey, don't you remember us?" Joe urged.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 " Yes, I remember,'' came the answer. '' And you were goin\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
g to catch Moe Gordon. But you haven't. You haven't. He still haunts me!" The poor fellow began to sob, then broke into a wild laugh. "He eats cheese all the time. I hate cheese! I hate him! But I can't get away from him!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys looked at each other.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  "I think we'd better leave," murmured Frank.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 167
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Webster nodded and they all filed out. "You see, he is much worse," said the father sadly when they reached his study.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe were forced to agree with him. "But we'll redouble our eff\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 orts to trap Moe Gordon," they promised.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Sympathetically they bade the broken-hearted man good-bye and drove off.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You know, Frank, I'm not certain we've figured out Narvey's case yet," said Joe. "There's something mighty strange about the whole situation.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Funny, but I've had the same feeling. Is the fellow going insane or by any chance has Gordon been here bothering him?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "From Narvey's words, one could certainly think that the crook has been," agreed Joe. "Or else Narvey }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 thinks }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you think we ought 'co notify the police to keep an eye on this place?" asked Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's wait a little while," suggested his brother. "Poor Mr. Webster has had so much trouble already. He probably does not want any further publicity."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For a good par\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
t of the remainder of the ride to the circus both were silent, each wrapped in his own thoughts. They listened to the radio for a while, then stopped for lunch. At last a signpost announced that Summit was only a mile away.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here we are," said Joe.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I can hardly wait to see Dad," added Frank as they neared the city. "I've been curious about what news he may have for us."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How are we supposed to find him in the midst of a circus? He didn't tell you where he'd be, did he?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fra\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nk shook his head. "You know Dad's methods, Joe. He doesn't give much information over a phone. Don't worry, he'll see to it that we find him.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The circus grounds were not hard to locate, for a large ferris wheel was visible for some distance. Covering se\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
veral acres around the giant structure were gaily decorated tents. Swarms of people were about.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Get the admission tickets while I park the car," said Frank excitedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A few moments later the brothers strolled arm in arm into the noisy area. At once Joe ex\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 claimed, '' Look at the side shows! Let's go into one."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His brother smilingly shook his head. '' Later. We'd better find Dad first. It's after three now.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys pushed their way through the crowds surging among the tents and food stands but saw no sign\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  of the detective.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Balloons? Balloons? Buy a balloon?" squawked a rough-looking vendor, jostling them rudely.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Hey, fellas! Buy a balloon! Only a nickel!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We don't want a balloon!" replied Frank with an emphatic gesture, but when he endeavored to push past the man the latter blocked his way.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' It looks as if we '11 have to \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
call out the Reserves to get rid of this fellow," said Joe under his breath. "If you don't mind," he added aloud, "we aren't the least bit interested in your balloons."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No?" The vendor's face bore a hurt expression. "You no likea my balloon? You no wanta \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 buy for some poor leetle kiddies? Look, I show you something special I''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Despite the boys' irritation their curiosity got the better of them. The man had transferred his string of toys to one hand while he fumbled in a torn pocket with the other. As Frank \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
and Joe watched mystified, the vendor drew forth a crumpled sheet of paper which he held toward them.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's this?" snorted Joe, staring at the man.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly his jaw dropped. He started to utter an exclamation but caught himself and reached for the paper.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Come on, Frank," he whispered, pulling his astounded brother through the crowd and off to

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's see what his note says. 'Dear Boys:' Try to get jobs with circus. Important. Meet me at main gate at closing time. Will explain later. Love, Dad.' "
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The openmouthed astonishment of the boys quickly gave way to determination to follow their disguised\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  parent's instructions. They would ask questions later.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll probably have better luck if we separate," suggested Joe. "I'll go down there by that snake pen and see what luck I have."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "All right. Meet you later."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank watched his brother disappear throu\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Pardon me, but could you by any chance give me a job helping you?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man whirled around. "You thinka you can feed elephants, young fellah?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How much mon' you wanta get pay?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The bronzed, ru\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 gged keeper looked at Frank dubiously. "You might get stepped on. Well, be verra careful. Go to the main office tent.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Thanking the keeper, Frank hurried through the throng and fou\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nd his way to a large tent near the entrance. A man in shirt sleeves looked up as he entered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'd like a job, sir. Mike over at the elephant tent sent me here. He said he'd take me on."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hmph. Gettin' lazy in his old age, is he? Needs more help, d\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oes he? Well, all right Come back here tonight for your pay."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 On his way back Frank kept a sharp lookout for any familiar faces. "There's a good chance that some of Hinchman's pals are here, otherwise Dad wouldn't have sent for us," he decided.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Yet he saw \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 no sign of him or Gordon. Arriving at the elephant tent he was handed a large pail of water.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Keepa out the way their tusks," warned Mike. '' Jest hold the pail tight and keepa your arms and hands away."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How does one hold a pail without using one's arms a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nd hands?" the boy chuckled to himself.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Nevertheless he went to work, refilling the pail at intervals as the elephants emptied it. At the same time he was alert to the remarks of the swarming bystanders in case one of them should turn out to be a suspiciou

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Nothing doing," snorted Mike, who happened to be standing at hand. '' Don't takea no peanuts from the crowd," he warned Frank. "Whata you think?\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
" he added, turning toward the onlookers. "My elephants get enough to eat."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Laughing to himself, Frank finally completed his rounds. His muscles aching, he put down the heavy pail and stood watching the crowd pressing around the rail. Suddenly he stiffened.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That fellow looks familiar," he said tensely to himself.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man whom his\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  quick eye had picked out was dressed in expensive clothes and apparently had had a recent shave and haircut.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I know! Hinchman!" flashed across Frank's brain. "Golly, I almost didn't recognize him all spruced up! Or is he Hinchman?" He stared at the man d\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oubtfully. "It's either he or his double!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Just then the fellow turned away and was swallowed up in the crowd.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 frank took a step forward. Should he attempt to follow Hinchman? The ex-candy store owner already was out of sight.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wassa matter?" cackled a voice just then. "You no got anything to do? Here, start cleaning the place.'' It was Mike. The humorous keeper handed Frank a huge mop. "You no lay down on the job so soon, no?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boy's first impulse was to fling away the mop\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  and run after the person he thought was Hinchman. An instant later he realized how foolish such a move would be.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll wait," he said to himself. "Sooner or later------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of a familiar face. Pretending not to no\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 tice his brother who came up just then, he walked casually toward the elephant nearest the rail.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's up, Frank? See anything suspicious?" came a whisper.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' I just saw Hinchman, Joe. At least I think so. All dressed up in sporty tweeds," the older boy \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 whispered out of the corner of his mouth.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What shall we do now, Dad?" Frank whispered tensely.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Look around a little, as soon as the last of the crowd leaves. Ah, the lights are out. I think we shall go for a casual stroll through the grounds."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Their father led them to a narrow path behind the te\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nts that bordered the edge of the circus plot.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think it would be unwise to walk along the

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 main paths. Keep your eyes and ears open, boys."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective suddenly seemed to freeze in his tracks. He appeared to be staring at some o\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 bject in the blackness. Then he motioned to his sons.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Crouch low and follow me, boys,'' were his words.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Wonderingly the brothers crawled through a patch of tall grass. A large canvas loomed directly ahead of them. The entrance flap was up, so they could\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  look inside.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's the snake tent," breathed Joe into Frank's ear. "That's where I was working this afternoon."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy halted suddenly. A tense silence followed. Then came a queer, scraping sound.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I can't see a thing. What's going on?" whispered Joe, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 who was behind the other two.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank repeated the question to his father. The latter cupped his hands to Frank's ear and whispered, "Somebody's trying to break the lock on the snakes' cage. Look slightly to the left. See?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His son's eyes fell on a bulky sha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 dow crouched directly in front of what appeared to be a barred door. The scraping sound continued. There was a loud }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Sh. Don't make a move," Mr. Hardy warned the boys almost soundlessly. "Someone's coming."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
As footsteps approached the tent, the crouched figure suddenly glided away. A new form loomed up. It was a watchman. He walked past the cage, and likewise disappeared. For several moments the detective and his sons remained motionless.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "All right\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , I think we're safe," said Fenton Hardy at length. "One of you go up and see what you find at the cage door.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll go," whispered Frank, and stole to the barred entrance. It seemed to his brother as if he were gone for an eternity, but finally he reappe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ared, very excited. "Look! Part of a sword blade! It must have broken off while that man was trying to open the lock with it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Is it a piece of the Crusader's sword?" whispered Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's too dark to see."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll examine it later," said Mr. Hardy. "We mus\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t get away from here without being seen.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 After tediously crawling on hands and knees the three reached the street fence. Quickly scaling it, they hurried to their cars and departed for a hotel where the detective had engaged rooms. At once the group bega
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n to examine the piece of weapon Frank had found.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Golly, it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If we recover the piece with his first name, we'll probab\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ly discover the thief who stole the

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And I'm s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
orry we didn't nab that fellow tonight," added the boys' father. "In my zeal to obtain conclusive proof, I'm afraid I let one of the trucking thieves slip through my fingers. Well, we'll have to renew our efforts."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the morning the brothers separated fro\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 m their father, promising to meet him at the main gate of the circus at midnight.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Before we go to work, let's find out if a man named Castillo who used to be a bullfighter is with this show," suggested Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good idea," said Joe. "I'll find a program." \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
He picked one from a trash basket. His eyes grew large as he skimmed through the list of names. "Here is one," he said. " 'Senor Castillo, Expert Aerialist.' "
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's hunt up the man right away," cried Frank. "Of course we'll have to be careful how we go a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 bout questioning him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys found the small, handsome, dark man in hfs dressing room, trying on a new suit for his act. He looked like anything but a thief as he stood there in a white satin shirt and tight-fitting breeches!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You like heem-my new cloth\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
es?" the performer smiled as the Hardys entered. "He is better than the last one. Now when I am way up at top the tent on my trapeze, everyone can see Senor Castillo," he added with pride.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That will be good," smiled Frank. "Such

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man beamed. "That ees correct. And now what can I do for you boys?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We're new here-just started working yesterday," spoke up Joe. "Thought we'd get a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 cquainted with the circus people."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Have you always been a trapeze performer?" asked Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, no, no," came the quick reply. "In the native land Senor Castillo was a great matador! But alas, there is no money-no more money in my poor country for the fam\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ous bullfighter. The war! The taxes! Oh, thees horrible thing they do to the great artist!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The temperamental man had to stop speaking for lack of breath. The Hardys were tingling with excitement. Perhaps they were talking with the very person who had Mr.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Barker's stolen estoque!

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Have you kept the sword you used when you were a bullfighter?" asked Frank, trying not to ehow any undue interest in the subject.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Si, si, but he is not in this country," Castillo answered. "Never would I part with heem, but he\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  is no use here. So I leave heem home."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The brothers wondered what they might say next, for they were not gleaning the information they wanted. At last Frank decided to take a bold step.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We know a man who has a wonderful collection of swords," he ventured\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 . Castillo

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 179
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 showed no special interest. "One of them is a matador's," the boy added, watching the actor closely. Still no sign of guilt on the face of this man, who continued to admire himself in a mirror. "It has been stolen!" cried
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the boy.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That ees too bad," said Castillo, not even flicking an eyelash. "You will excuse me now. I change my clothes. You are nice boys. Come again sometime. Then I show you my new estoque. I just get heem. He is beautiful.''

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At this announcement the Ha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rdys nearly gave themselves away. Only because of long training with their father were they able to hide the excitement they felt.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, please show it to us now," begged Joe, trying to appear as innocent in his desire as a pleading child. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Please!"}{

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You will be late to work," laughed the performer. "Then the Big Top Hinch-a-man, he be mad. But I show you."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man opened a trunk and reached to the bottom of it. In a second he was displaying a fine, short sword with a beautiful jeweled hilt. At once t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
he Hardys recognized it, from the photograph they had seen, as belonging to Mr. Barker.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh!" cried both boys together.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You exclaim!" laughed the ex-matador. "No wonder. He is very gorgeous, si, si."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Convinced that this man had obtained possession of the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 estoque by honest means, the brothers disliked having to tell him the truth.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 180 The Clue of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For several seconds no one spoke. Over the actor's head Frank moved his lips soundlessly to form the words, "Shall we tell him?" Joe nodded to go \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ahead.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Senor Castillo," Frank began, "would you mind telling us where you got this sword?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' I buy heem-from some man. I do not know thees man. One day I tell heem I would like to buy a beautiful estoque some time. Bye-m-bye he come back with thees one."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"I am afraid you will have to give it up," said Joe as kindly as possible. "Unfortunately this is the sword which was taken from the collection my brother told you about a few minutes ago. The man who sold it to you stole it!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Castillo turned white, then \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 red. "What you say! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Caramba! }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Seizing the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
estoque which he had laid on a table he began brandishing it, then held it in front of him as if he were about to stab an on-rushing bull. Frightened, the boys ran from the tent, the cry ringing in their ears, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What'11 we do now?" gasped Joe, when he and his brother were a safe distance away. "Wow, is he mad!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I know what I'll do," laughed Frank. "Hide in the elephant's pen till Castillo cools off!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Gue\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ss I better go about my work, too," said Joe. "Well, see you later. It's great having found Mr. Barker's sword, isn't it?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Chet really did help solve that mystery," added Frank. "We'll have to buy him more than a quart of ice cream for his good work."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  might get him a fencing foil," Joe grinned as he moved off.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He hurried down a path toward the snake cage. As he passed one of the small tents, he heard a loud voice that made him stop in his tracks.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You want to use our supply headquarters for a warehouse\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , you say?" queried the voice.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 On impulse the boy crept up to the flap and peered inside. He suppressed an exclamation as he recognized Big Top Hinchman with his mouth glued to a telephone.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You say the explosion wrecked your place, Charlie?" A staccato so\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
und crackled through the receiver. Then Big Top spoke again. "Well, all right, you can use our circus storage warehouse for a while. What's that? Sure, we'll need it later."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The receiver was banged back on the hook.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hm," mused Joe, his pulses quickening. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here's a real clue to Hinchman and those other thieves. I wonder if Big Top knows what they're up to?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 deciding this bit of news was worth communicating to his brother at once, Joe hurried to the elephants' pen. The keeper was \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 not around, so the boys could talk freely.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Gee, you certainly did get a clue," agreed Frank after he had heard Joe's story. "Dad ought to be told."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Guess we can't do that until midnight," said Joe. "In the meantime we ought t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 o try to find out where the supply headquarters of the circus is located.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That ought to be easy," commented Frank. "Any of the people working here can tell us, only we 'd better not seem too interested. Somebody might become suspicious. I'll ask Mike wh\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
en he gets back."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys separated, Joe going to the snake tent. The elephants' keeper soon returned. He beamed broadly at Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here you are, my lad! Plenty heavy work, yes?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Elephants eat an awful lot, don't they?" remarked the boy. "Where do you ge\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t their feed? It must cost a circus a good deal."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With that Mike was off to give orders to \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
some of his other helpers loitering about. Grinning to himself Frank worked hard, not forgetting to keep one eye on the crowd for possible suspicious faces. Early in the evening the superintendent of the circus appeared on his round of inspection.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hello,"\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  he said with a friendly wave of his hand. "How are you getting along?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Very well, thank you, Mr. Smith," Frank replied.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How would you and your brother like to knock off work for the rest of the day and see the performance with me ?'' the man asked. '' I\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 want to watch part of the show tonight and I'd like company."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank needed no second invitation. Bounding up Joe and informing him of the treat in store, they set off. A short time later they joined the superintendent and soon were watching the exciting a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
nd dangerous feats of the aerial troupe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Isn't that Senor Castillo up there on the trapeze ?'' asked Frank. '' The man who has on a white satin suit!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, it is," replied Mr. Smith. "Excellent performer."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Openmouthed, the boys watched the skill and gra\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ce of Castillo and the other two men with

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you think you could turn three somersaults in mid-air like that, Frank?" laughed Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "One would\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  do," replied his brother. "Although I have done a double one diving into the water," he added.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you boys go in for a lot of athletics?" asked Mr. Smith.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We do as much as we can," replied Joe. "At High School we're members of a gymnasium club, which ha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s given a few exhibitions."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Finally, when the show ended, the boys sighed disappointedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I could watch that all night, Mr. Smith," said Joe to the superintendent. "Thank you so much for letting us off from work and inviting us here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Shortly after midnig\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ht, as the lights of the circus grounds were extinguished, the boys found their father waiting for them near the entrance.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Any plans?" Joe queried.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Nothing special. I'm wondering whether you boys have anything to report ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Plenty, Dad," whispered Joe tensely, telling the story of the discovery of the stolen estoque.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Fine work," the detective praised his sons. "You should let Mr. Barker know about this right away."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At this announcement Mr. Hardy actually hugged his sons. "Wonderful!" he exclaimed. "I'll go there and check up."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "When?" Frank asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Tomorrow morning. I don't know when I shall return, but I'll be in touch with you."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wonder what's up?" said Frank. "Hope he hasn't found out our real reason for being here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 What the man had to s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ay was a great surprise indeed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Good morning, boys,'' he boomed, grasping each of them by a hand and leading them toward the office tent. "I have an offer for both of you."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys' eyes opened wide. Expectantly they waited for the man's next words.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t seems that three of my acrobats have been taken ill. Food poisoning. I recall what you told me last night about your gymnastic

to-take the places of the other two?" Joe asked incredulously.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, that is my offer. At this time of the season I can get no trained acrobats as substitutes. I have only two alternatives. Either I must skip the a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ct entirely, or use you boys."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank's eyes flashed. "We'll be glad to help you," he said eagerly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Out of the corner of his eye he could see Joe's jaw dropping in surprise. But the younger lad was just as game as his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Good. The first show isn 't\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  until two o 'clock this afternoon. Go over to the tent now and you'll have two hours to rehearse."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Conferring excitedly, the boys hurried away. As they entered the big tent, a pang went through Frank. "There's Castillo, Joe. Guess he's the other substitut\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e. Do you suppose he has forgiven us yet?" he whispered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was soon evident that the former bullfighter had not forgotten his grievance. Informed that the boys were to take part in the show, he exploded in a volley of words the boys could not understand. 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It took the combined efforts of the other performers to quiet him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, all right, I behave," he said sullenly. '' But one week salary-he gone to a thief! Now you boys practice. I watch you fall off the trapeze, yes?" he laughed.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Soon the rehearsal was progressing in ear* nest. To everyone's delight the brothers did remarkably well. The regular performers changed their act a little to suit the ability of the Hardys but were amazed at the lads' skill.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "All right, that ees enough for\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  now," said Castillo at length. '' Go rest and be back here by two o'clock for the main show."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Tingling with anticipation, the boys walked up and down the circus grounds until the appointed hour. When they entered the big tent again it was literally jammed\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  with spectators.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Nervous, Joe?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A little. I wouldn't mind so much if we weren't working with Castillo. He's still upset-and temperamental. No telling what he may do."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When it was time for their act, the band blared forth. The Hardys climbed to a trapeze\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
. The first stunts went all right. Then came the moment for the difficult one. Sefior Castillo, swinging above the others by his heels, awaited word from the announcer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "L-a-d-e-e-z and gentlemun," called the ring, master in stentorian tones. "Introducing \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 a new and daring act! You will now see one somersault after another in lightning succession. ''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the drums rolled the three regular actors turned in the air, caught Castillo's hands, and swung back to their trapezes.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Keady?" snapped Castillo to Frank.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Beady!" called the boy, bracing himself.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He flipped over, missed the Senor, and tumbled headlong into the net. The crowd booed and the boy flushed furiously.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As he watched in anguish, his brother met the same fate, landing \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 in the great net. Again the vast crowd roared its disgust. Climbing to the ground, Joe joined his brother.

wasn't our fault, Frank, it was Castillo's," the younger boy said angrily. "He deliberately timed his swing so he couldn't catch hold!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Joe, let\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 's do that somersault stunt we did at the last gym club show at high school."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Just give me a chance!" agreed his brother. "Come on, we'll show Senor Castillo and everybody else just what we can do."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At this point one of the clowns, who had overheard the r\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
emark, paused in his antics. When Frank and Joe started their act, to the surprise of the announcer and Castillo, the funny man joined the boys. What might have been just a clever but plain acrobatic performance on the part of the Hardys now turned into a
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  amazing and sidesplitting number. The audience clapped and howled its approval, asking for an encore.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You ought to join us permanently," said the clown as the three bowed and walked off. '' Say, come on into my dressing room for a while. I'd like to know\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  you better."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Thanking the man for his helpfulness, the boys followed him into one of the dressing

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you mean to tell me you're just amateurs'?" queried the clown incredulously. "Why, I've been knocking around circuses all my life and I supposed you were old-timers."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe chuckled. "I'll have to tell our gym teacher that. Incidentally,\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 while you two fellows are talking, I think I'll run over and see how my snake pen is getting along. I told the keeper I'd take care of his job between shows."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank had been studying the young clown. Maybe the friendly man could give him some useful infor\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 mation in regard to Big Top's brother and his pals.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do any of the circus owner's relatives work here?" the boy asked to lead the conversation in that direction.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not any more," replied the clown. "One used to, but he had to leave. Big Top caught him stealing things and there was a big rumpus. It was hushed up, 'cause he was a cousin, so not many of the performers knew about it."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What was his name?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Moe Gordon,\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' came the startling reply. "I never liked him. Too free and easy with knives. Seemed to know a lot about them-and swords too."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank could hardly contain himself and was about to ask another leading question, when
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 190 The Clue of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the clo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 wn made a further amazing announcement.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I sure was sorry about one thing," he said. "We had a nice young trapeze performer here named Marko. That wasn't his right name. He never told me who he was, but I had an idea he was a rich man's son and had run awa
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 y from home."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At once Frank's mind leaped to Narvey.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Poor Marko fell and became lame," went on the clown. "After that he got in Gordon's clutches and had to leave, too. I'm afraid the poor fellow may have told the thief he has a wealthy father and been ma
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 de to get money out of him for Gordon."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Did this Marko suffer from loss of memory after his fall?" asked Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That I don't know," said the circus man. "But he certainly did act differently."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Before leaving to tell Joe what he had learned, Frank asked o\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ne more question. "Did Castillo know Gordon?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The clown looked surprised but replied,'' Castillo joined us just before Gordon was asked to leave, so I don't believe he did."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Thanking the friendly man again for his help in the acrobatic act, the Hardy boy l\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 eft the tent. He almost bumped into his brother who was running toward him, wild-eyed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Something terrible has happened!" Joe yelled. "One of the poisonous snakes is missing!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 fbank at once looked concerned. "Thatvs bad! We'd\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  better tell the superintendent, Joe. Somebody may be bitten.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys sought out Mr. Smith, who raced over to the snake tent with them. "Where's the head keeper?" the man cried. "Had no business leaving his job."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How did you find out one snake was miss\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ing?" Frank asked his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "When I fed them, I counted," Joe replied. "One was gone."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The superintendent glowered. "That's a fine how-do-ye-do! A viper loose! People wanderin' around!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank, calmer, asked, "Don't you think we'd better look for the sna\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ke?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You bet we'd better start lookin', and that keeper is goin' to lose his job. Tony!" he shouted to a helper. '' Go get the boss, quick!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The circus owner was not long in arriving. Looking like a dapper sportsman in his natty tweeds he trotted up to t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hem, his face livid.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's this I hear about a snake escaping?" he hissed.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 192 The Clue of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 growled the superintendent, motioning toward Joe. "A poisonous one at that."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"Good heavens, man, do you know what that means if the public should get wind of it?" cried Big Top Hinchman. "Nobody'11 come to the show! Start a search of the grounds at once," the owner ordered. His voice dropped to a hoarse whisper. "Whatever you do, 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 on't let the customers know what's going on."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys as well as the men hunted everywhere on the grounds but the missing reptile Was not found. At last they gave it up. The Hardys drew off by themselves and began to discuss the many things they had found
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  out during the past few hours.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I believe that snake was stolen!" decided Joe. "The lock was tampered with, as we know. And it was done by the person with the broken blade of the Crusader's sword.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank slapped his knee. "I'll bet you that person is Moe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 Gordon!" he cried, and told Joe the clown's story. "Gordon's sore at Big Top and what better way to get back at him than to let a dangerous snake loose at a circus? Furthermore, the clown said Moe liked knives and ewords, so he's probably the one who use
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the blade to open the cage."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Your theory sounds good,'' said Joe. " And since two and two make four, Gordon is the one who sold the stolen estoque to Castillo."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, it looks as if our case is narrowing,"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Missing Snake 193
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 agreed Frank. "Either Ch\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
arlie Hinchman or Gordon took the piece of the Crusader's sword from Mr. Barker's office and the matador's estoque from his home, but Gordon probably is the one who had them later."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Tell me again about the young man called Marko," asked Joe. "It certainly\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  sounds as if he is Narvey."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank reiterated the clown's words, including the man's worry that the lame circus chap probably was under Gordon's influence still and might even be getting money in some way from a wealthy father to give to the crook.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ould explain why Narvey's condition doesn't improve," he concluded. "If he is in constant fear of Gordon and is forced by him to ask his father for money, no wonder the poor fellow's mind is in a turmoil. That's enough to put a well person in a state of a
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 m\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nesia!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"I think we ought to go out to High Point and have a talk with Mr. Webster," said Joe. "We can find out if Narvey called himself Marko. If so, he may even tell us that Gordon comes there. And this time we'll catch that thief!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys decided to g\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
o the next day, so at midnight when they received their wages they said they would not be back to work in the morning. After a good sleep at the hotel, they telephoned their home. Mr. and Mrs. Hardy still were away, Aunt Gertrude reported. Her

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Laughing, the brothers hurried to the hotel dining room for breakfast. Joe bought a morning newspaper and at once exclaimed over a prominent headline.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Tensely they scanned the paragraphs telling of their famous father's brilliant work in capturing the men, including the head bookkeeper, who had escaped\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 through the tunnel. At the end of the column it was stated that two of the ringleaders were still at large.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Charlie Hinchman and Moe Gordon!" exclaimed Frank. "Maybe we'll catch one of them before long!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A drive of several hours brought them again to Hig\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 h Point. Tensely they rang the bell and waited for the butler to open the front door.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good mawnin', gen'mun," greeted the shining-faced servant a moment later. "Mistah Webster is in his study."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ''How is Narvey?" Joe asked at once.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Narvey is no better," was the sad reply. "If anything, he is worse," Mr. "Webster went on.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardy\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 boys expressed their sympathy and wanted to tell the man what they suspected, but in all fairness to Narvey they felt they should speak to the young man first. Accordingly they went upstairs alone to see him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Suppose he won't tell us anything," whispered\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Joe. "If Gordon has such a hold on him, he may be afraid to speak the truth.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's true," agreed Frank in a hushed tone. "I believe the best plan would be to surprise him and pretend we know more than we do."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Accordingly when they reached Narvey's bed\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 room, the older brother pushed open the door a little way and called in a hoarse voice, "Hello, Marko!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Gordon!" replied a faint voice from the bed. "Go away! Leave me alone! I haven't any more money to give you now. You said you wouldn't come back until \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 tomorrow."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Changing their plans completely, the boys tiptoed away and returned to the first floor. There they had a long talk with Mr. Webster, relating everything they had learned at the circus. The man told them that to humor his

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Narvey has been around the grounds'!" ask\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed Frank. "He hasn't remained in the house every minute ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' My son went out a few times, always alone,'' the father answered. "Once when I was worried because he didn't return for half an hour, I went to look for him. But he was all right, although he s
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 eemed very excited and asked me not to follow him again."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Probably he was giving the money to Gordon at that time," said Joe. "One thing is certain: the crook will be back, so he can be nabbed right here tomorrow.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Webster begged the boys not to leav\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e High Point, even for an hour. His eyes were so full of fear and his tone so pleading that they agreed. They spent the balance of the day looking about the grounds, wondering where the meeting place of Narvey and Gordon might be. There were several seclu

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I vote for the little empty house at the edge of the estate," said Joe. "That's where I'll watch for Gordon."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Narvey appeared at suppertime and showed a forced interest in seeing the Hardy boys. He

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He certainly is no better," said Frank to Joe as they were undressing later. "I b\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 elieve the only thing that will restore Narvey's mind is a great shock of some kind."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Maybe,'' yawned Joe. '' Well, good night,'' he added, tumbling into bed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The village clock had just struck midnight, when there came a slight rustling sound from somew\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
here among the bushes directly beneath Mr. Webster's room. A shadowy figure detached itself from the shrubs and slowly climbed a stout vine leading toward an open window.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "what's that?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank Hardy sat bolt upright in bed, listening intently.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Joe, wake up! Hear that moaning ?" he called to his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't hear anything," said Joe, yawning.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's time to get up anyway. It's seven o'clock," his brother told him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe arose, and star\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ted to dress. He halted abruptly. "Frank! I do hear something! Listen!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A distinct moaning sound pervaded the room. At first the boys could not decide from what direction it came. Joe went to the window and peered out.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Nothing wrong so far as I can see, F\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rank."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think it's coming from somewhere in the house, Joe. Listen, there it goes again. It }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 is }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 a groan; there's no doubt about it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Anxiously the boys pulled on their clothes and stole into the long corridor. The sound was distinctly louder. Again and again it came, a low, guttural groan. The boys now were thoroughly alarmed.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 199
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's find the butler, Frank. W\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ait here, I'11 get him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Returning with the Negro a few minutes later, Joe found his brother attempting to force a locked door at the end of the hallway.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's Mistah Webster's room!" exclaimed the butler, his eyes rolling fearfully. "Is he sick ? Lawd h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e 'p us!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man was too frightened to be of much assistance to them. Joe hurried ahead to join his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Guess we'll have to break in," panted Frank. '' Ready ? One, two, three!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Together the boys hurled their combined strength against the stout pan\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 el, behind which the sounds of groaning were now louder than ever. To their dismay the door failed to budge even slightly.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's very strongly built," muttered Frank "We may have to get in by a window.!'
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For a brief instant they listened to the groans, whi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ch grew more and more terrifying.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Whatever has happened to Mr. Webster must be something pretty awful, Frank. Golly, it gives me the shivers even to listen to him.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Me, too. Let's give this door another try."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Again and again they threw themselves agains\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t the thick wood but without success. The groaning, meantime, had all but ceased.
\par \loch\af1\dbch\af31505\hich\f1 \'ab\loch\f1 ' Mr. Webster!'' Frank called softly. '' Mr. Webster, are you-all right!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 200 The Clue of the Broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was no answer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We may be too late," said Frank gravely. "Come, let's try the window."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The brothers raced downstairs and outside. "That must be his room," said Joe a few moments later, pointing overhead.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' The window's closed. That's queer. You 'd think he 'd have it op\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 en in warm weather.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe he shut it when he started to dress. Frank, we'll have to find a ladder somewhere."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' There's the garage. Let's have a look.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fortunately the building was unlocked. Hastily rummaging about they did find a ladder which they qu\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ickly carried to the house. With Joe bracing its base in the soft earth, Frank climbed slowly toward the window in question. Tensely Joe watched. '' See anything, Frank ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not yet. I'm trying to get in."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a sudden grinding sound, and the window \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 opened. Joe heard his brother gasp.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Frank! What is it?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Hurry inside the house, Joe. I '11 unlock the bedroom door for you."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Swiftly Frank climbed over the ledge and into the room. He unlocked the door just as Joe's footsteps sounded on the stairway. A\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
n instant later the boys were standing over the prostrate form of Mr. Webster stretched out on the floor near a window.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He's still alive, but his pulse is very weak," whispered Frank, touching the old man's wrist
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Puzzling Attack 201
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 gently. "Better ge\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t a doctor as quickly as possible. Ask the butler. Maybe he knows one."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Negro was hovering in the hall not daring to look inside the room. Joe rushed up to him. "Do you know who Mr. Webster's doctor 'is?" he asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Y-yes, I know, b-but I cain't think.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Oh, if Mistah Webster should die an' leave that awful boy!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Without waiting any longer, Joe dashed to the telephone in the study and called the operator.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Send a doctor to Axel Webster's home right away," he ordered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Putting down the receiver, he raced \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 upstairs, where Frank already had collected some towels, soaked them in cold water, and applied them to the patient's head.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He's sinking, I'm afraid," the boy said in a hushed tone. "He must have had a heart attack. I certainly don't see any sign of a wou\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nd on him, do you?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Footsteps sounded on the staircase. A tall man carrying a black bag hurried into the room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What has happened?" he queried, looking around sharply.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank pointed to the millionaire's still figure, which they had laid upon the bed. The d\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
octor began his examination. He listened to the old man's heart, and a grim expression came over his face.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 202 The Clue of the broken Blade
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Very bad, very bad," he muttered. "The patient's condition is desperate, and I believe it's not his heart alone."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Have you any idea what caused it, Doctor?" Frank asked in concern.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The physician shook his head. "It puzzles me. I cannot understand it. I shall administer a drug at once."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Completing the injection the doctor went downstairs to make a telephone call. In the meantime Frank had been leaning out the window.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Joe! Come here a minute," he called in a hoarse whisper.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What do you see?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Look at this vine. It's ruffled up and brok\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 en off in places. It looks as if someone had climbed it very recently. Let's go downstairs and look at it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When the physician returned, the boys hurried below to examine the vine and the ground around it. Fresh footprints leading to the spot below the win\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
dow were proof that a person with a large-size shoe had climbed to the room above on the heavy creeper.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe Mr. Webster was poisoned!" exclaimed Frank. '' Let's ask the doctor.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You don't suppose Narvey-" began Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, no," said Frank quickly. "Not \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 even under Gordon's influence. But say, it might have bee*1 Gordon himself."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Puzzling Attack 203
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What possible reason would he have for doing such a thing?" objected Joe. "He was getting money out of the old man as it was. Why would he spoil that litt\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 le game }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Frank, thinking this over, did not reply until the boys, deciding to enter the house, reached the front door. '' I wonder if Mr. Webster was going to leave his fortune to Narvey,'' he said. "If so, Gordon may have wanted to get a big slice of i
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t while he still had Narvey in his power."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You mean that if young Webster's memory should return, he'd have nothing to do with Gordon, so the crook would not benefit from the father's death?" said Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Exactly. Let's speak to the doctor about the idea of\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  poison."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Before the boys reached the hall, a taxi pulled up to the door. Out stepped Fenton Hardy.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Dad!'' both boys exclaimed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What has happened here?" he asked quickly. "When your Aunt Gertrude told me you had left the circus to come to High Point, I\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  was sure you had learned something important."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When the detective, seated in the library, had been told the whole story of what clues his sons had uncovered since he had left them, he praised them warmly. "I'm mighty proud of you both," he beamed. "Later 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 we'll have a celebration for your good work. Eight now we

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' And the piece of blade marked ' Edouard,' '' added Frank. "I want to return every bit of the weapon to Mr. Barke\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 r."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't forget that the person who sold the estoque to Castillo will have to give back the poor matador's 'one week salary,' " chimed in Joe, grinning.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's go upstairs now and see how Mr. Webster is,'' suggested his father. '' You boys tell the docto\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 r your suspicions. It's possible them------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At this moment a horrible shriek resounded throughout the mansion and brought the Hardys to their feet with a bound.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It came from upstairs," cried Frank, dashing from the room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys ascended the staircase t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 wo steps at a time.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, oh," groaned a voice, and Narvey limped toward them. "A snake bit my ankle I" he cried, and fell to the floor.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 CHAPTER XXIV
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 REVELATION
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 quickly the boys helped Narvey to his feet and ca\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rried him into his room. He was too panic-stricken to speak for a few seconds, then he blurted out:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's in the hall. The terrible snake is in the hall!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll get the doctor right away," offered Frank, dashing off. "He's in your father's room."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The doct\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 or?" Narvey repeated the boy's words. '' Why is he here ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Mr. Webster-your father-is very ill," replied Joe. '' Didn 't you know ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The young man on the bed gave a scream of terror. "No, oh, no. This is the end!" he cried, covering his face with his ha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nds.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Frank returned with the physician, who immediately opened his kit to take out a bottle of snake serum and administer a dose at once. As the Hardys went to the hall to look for the reptile, they saw their father in a dark corner strike at something wit
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 h the legs of a chair he held in his hands.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's gone!" he cried as his sons rushed up. "I missed it. Be careful, boys," be warned

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Bach searcher went a differ\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ent way. Frank had hardly entered one of the rooms when he stiffened. He had heard a suspicious rustling sound beneath the bed. Before investigating further he looked around for a possible weapon.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That ought to do the trick," he muttered as his eyes fell \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 upon a heavy cane standing in a corner. Stealthily he picked it up and leaned over, squinting into the shadows under the bed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a menacing buz-z-z, followed by a slithering sound as an angry snake reared to attack him. Frank's action was automatic.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Down came the cane with a terrific }{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' What's happening ? Did you get it ?" burst out Joe, running into the room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He uttered a cry of relief as he saw the ugly reptile stretched out motionless on the floor. " Here \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 it is, Dad! Frank killed it!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Instantly his father came into the room. Joe, upon looking at the viper, exclaimed:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' That snake is exactly like the one which escaped from my circus pen!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Beally?" said Mr. Hardy with a grave look.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It may not be the same \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 one, of course, but it's the same size and kind."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank's expression changed to one of doubt. "That's pretty farfetched, Joe. How could it have got here unless somebody carried it ?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Revelation 207
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's just the point, Frank. Maybe somebody }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid12651623 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 did }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid12651623

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy had stepped into the hall and spoken to the doctor who had just come from Narvey's room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If Mr. Webster's condition is due to a snake bite, his chance\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
s of recovery are excellent," the physician was saying as the boys joined them. "Now I shall be able to administer the correct treatment."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As soon as the doctor had gone, the Hardys discussed Joe's idea about Gordon.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
'' If your theory is right,'' said the detective, "and Gordon used this means to hasten Mr. Webster's end, then he is a worse criminal than I suspected. In any case, there should be a police guard here. I'll go downstairs and telephone for one at once.''

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 T\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he detective called the local headquarters and told the story. He asked that a couple of men be sent out disguised as outdoor workmen.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the meantime a young man who lay on a bed in an attractively-furnished room near-by slowly arose and looked about him \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
perplexed. As he started to walk toward a window he gazed down ruefully at his lame leg.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How did I get here?" he asked himself. "Yes, this is my bedroom. But I ran away and

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 joined a circus under the name of Marko. Oh yes, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 I remember, I fell and everything went black. How long ago was that ?''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Try as he might, the young man could recall nothing from the moment he had slipped from the trapeze. '' I must go and find my father at once," lie decided. "I hope he has forgiven me."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The son hurried to the hall door and opened it. He was confronted by two strange boys.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hello, Narvey," one of them said. "Feeling better?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You know me?" the young man asked, smiling. "I'm sorry, but I do not recall having met you.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys-for it wa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s they-exchanged glances. What was young Webster up to now? When they did not reply, Narvey asked pleasantly :
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you know where my father is?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, we do, and you do, too," exploded Joe. "Your friend Moe Gordon fixed him up!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 " Moe Gordon ?'' the young \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 man repeated. '' I never heard of him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Now listen, Narvey Webster," cried Joe. "I don't know what you're up to, but whatever it is, it's not going to get by Frank and me!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank was studying Narvey intently. Somehow young Webster seemed different. He sto\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 od up straighter, his voice was firmer, and the haunting fear was gone from his eyes. Quietly
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Revelation 209
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank squeezed Joe's hand in a warning signal the boys sometimes used.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Narvey, would you mind coming downstairs with us ? " the older boy asked \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 cordially. "We'd like to talk to you before you try to see your father."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 \hich\f1 " I 'd be glad to,'' replied the other. \'ab\'ab\loch\f1 But- but you aren't going to tell me my Dad isn't living1? Oh, I couldn't bear that! You hinted------"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Mr. Webster is alive, but has been da\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ngerously ill," said Frank. "However, we have every reason to believe that he will be better very soon."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boy led the trio downstairs. Reaching the library, he quickly whispered a few words to his father who was just coming from the telephone.

e house on the edge of the grounds was chosen as the likely spot.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There are recent footprints around it and other marks leading toward a section of fence that has been broken," explained Frank. "I believe that's the way by which Gordon comes and goes."

e probable time of meeting was guessed after Joe had consulted the butler about what hour Narvey usually left the house whenever he went outdoors. Four o'clock was decided upon and it was agreed that the boys would remain indoors so as not to be observed.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, I did," the physician confirmed, "so I gave him the proper serum. He did not respond as quickly as his son, due to his age and the fact that he did not receive the antidote immediately. ''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "May I see him now?" Narvey\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  asked excitedly. "I have so much to say to him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes," answered the medical man. "He regained consciousness some time ago. He is feeling weak, of course, and must stay in bed, but otherwise he is all right."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Narvey hurried from the room and went up the s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You mean the shock caused by the snake bite?" Mr. Webster asked. "I see. My son tells me you have not quite finished your work and that h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fearfully the brothers drew closer. Suddenly a door slammed and the conversation inside the building ceased. Standing back of the house, the boys could not see whether one person or more had left the place.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's look inside," ventured F\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rank when they were within a few feet of an open window. "You stand guard."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Only one person in there and he's eating cheese!" Frank muttered under his breath.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Eating ch-Gordon!" whispered his brother, his eyes blazing. '' Narvey told us that Moe Gordon likes-----"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "All right. "Wonder where Narvey is."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Stealthily the Hardys crept to the front of the little building. At a signal they burst through the do\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 orway.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What!" exploded a vicious voice. "Look out, or I'll-----"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys stopped short as they found themselves confronted by a sharp, glistening blade. Gordon-for it was he-sneered at them, gesticulating with the weapon.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Simultaneously there was a yell from a corner of the room. To the astonishment of the boys the door of a large closet popped open and Narvey jumped out.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll give you a hand!" he cried, jumping on Gordon, who struggled desperately. '' B\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 eat him up!" the young man shouted, pounding the man whom Frank and Joe now were holding tightly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly a shadow fell across the doorway.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Stop!" barked a voice. "Put up your hands!"

hidden by Narvey's body, quickly moved from his pocket to his mouth. A second later there came a shrill blast from a police whistle. Frank instantly rolled from Gordon's form and lunged toward Hinchman, who had been taken off guard by the signal.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "After hi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 m," yelled Joe as the crook whirled around to dash from the cottage.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The men have him," said a voice and Mr. Hardy stepped into the cabin a moment later. '' And you have Gordon, too. Go\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 od work, boys.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the meantime Joe had picked up the weapon the man had used. It was part of a sword blade. Quickly he looked for a name on it.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Dad! Frank! It says 'Edouard' onhere!" he cried. "Now we have all the pieces of the Crusader's sword!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 After the police had led the man \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1
