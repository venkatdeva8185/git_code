powerful motorcycles sped along the shore road that leads from the city of Bayport, skirting \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Barmet Bay, on the Atlantic coast. It was a bright Saturday morning in June, and although the city sweltered in the heat, cool breezes blew in from the bay.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Two of the motorcycles carried an extra passenger. All the cyclists were boys of about fifteen and \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
sixteen years of age and all five were students at the Bayport high school. They were enjoying their Saturday holiday by this outing, glad of the chance to get away from the torrid warmth of the city for a few hours.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The two remaining motorcycles came to a stop and the drivers mopped their brows while the two other boys dismounted, glad of the chance to stretch their legs. One of the cyclists\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was evident from the struggles of the man in the water that he was not an expert swimmer. So far, he had not seen the boys, but they could hear him shouting for help, possibly thinking, however, that it 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 was in vain, for it was a lonely part of the bay and the nearest farmhouse, outside of the deserted Polucca place, was more than half a mile down the road.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Quick!" shouted Frank. "I see a rowboat up on the shore."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His sharp eyes had discerned a small boat\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 almost hidden in a little cove some distance away at the bottom of a steep declivity that was the beginning of the cliff. It could not be reached by going along the shore, and the boys saw that they would have to go along the high ground and then descend
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 to it, for a huge rock that jutted out of the deep water cut the cove off from the more open part of the beach.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They left their motorcycles on the side of the road and hurried back up the slope, then cut down across a narrow strip of weeds and grass until \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
they came to the top of the declivity. They could still see the victim of the explosion struggling in the waves. The man had seized a piece of wreckage and was able to remain afloat, but the boys knew it was only a matter of time before his strength would
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 give out.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Looks to be almost all in," remarked Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I wonder if he's anybody we know," came from his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It isn't likely." Frank reached out suddenly and caught hold of Joe's arm. "Look out there or you may break a leg."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It certainly is mighty s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 lippery," answered Joe, as he managed to regain his footing. He had come close to going heels over head on the rocks.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Slipping and scrambling, they made their way down the slope toward the little cove. Rocks went rolling and tumbling ahead of them. The dis\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
tance was only a few yards, but the elope was steep and a false step might result in broken bones.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But they reached the bottom in safety and there they came upon the rowboat. It was battered and old, but evidently still seaworthy.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Into the water with her!\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 " said Frank.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He'd be better off if he kept quiet," Joe said. "He's only wasting his strength."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Evidently this thought occurred to the victim of the wreck, or else he was becoming weaker, for his cries d\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ied away and the boys did not hear him again.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank thought he may have gone beneath the waves, and he cast a quick look around. But the fellow was still in view, clinging desperately to his bit of wreckage.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The motorboat in the background was still blazin\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As for the other motorboat, Frank could hear the roar of its exhaust as it continued its flight out i\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
nto the bay. For a while he could see its dim shape, when he turned around once in a while, but then the fleeing boat disappeared into the mist and the gloom.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys exerted all their strength and the little rowboat fairly leaped over the waves.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Both wer\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e good oarsmen and it was not long before they had drawn close to the man in the water.

e too late.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When they were only a few yards away Frank looked around, to shout encouragement to the victim of the wreck. Even as he \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 looked, he saw the man wearily give up his grasp on the pie}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He's drowning, Joe!" shouted Frank, as h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e bent to his oar again.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a mighty effort they brought the boat close by the place where the man had gone down.

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 peered down into the depths. He began taking off his coat, preparatory to diving to the rescue.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Then the fellow came to the surface again, gasping for breath, but so weak that he could scarcely make a struggle. He emerged from the water, right beside the boat and Frank leaned over, grasping him by the hair. This sufficed to prevent the man from sink
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 i\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ng for the second time, and Frank managed to get a grip on the collar of his coat.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then, with Joe helping and in imminent danger of upsetting the boat, he managed to drag the stranger to the side of the craft.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The fellow was a dead weight, for he had lapse\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
d into unconsciousness when Frank seized him, but somehow they contrived to get him into the boat, and there he lay, sprawled helplessly, more dead than alive.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'd better get him to shelter some place and revive him," said Joe. "We can't do much for him \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How about that farmhouse down the bay!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They finally located the farmhouse, a snug little building back off the main road some distance down the bay. It meant considerable rowing, but there was a life at stake.

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 was a roaring mass of flames. Then it began to sink beneath the waves. There was a great hissing sound and a heavy cloud of steam as the craft sank lower and lower into the water, its blazing embers blackening to the touch of the 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
sea. Swiftly, at last, the boat disappeared. Its' stern seemed to hesitate for a moment, and then it slid quickly down into the waves and the only trace was a widening pool of oil and scattered wreckage on the surface of the water.

ere could not be much water in his lungs. He had simply given in to exhaustion and fatigue resulting from his long struggle in the waves.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They headed the boat down the bay, in a direct line with the little farmhouse, which they could see nestling among the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 trees. They had already spent much energy in rowing out to the rescue of the stranger, but they fell to the new task with a will. Bowing with machine-like precision, they felt the little boat respond to every effort, and it fairly leaped along. This time
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 they had the wind and the waves with them and they made good time.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man they had rescued lay face downward in the bottom of the boat. He was a slim, black-haired fellow. His clothes, which of course were soaked with water, were cheap and worn, the sleev\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

They sat down to the simple but ample meal, typical farm fare of roast beef and baked pork and beans, with creamy mashed potatoes, topped off with a rich lemon pie, frothy with meringue, and fragrant coffee. During the meal they discussed the strange
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  affair of the bay. The Hardy boys did not mention }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid1519798 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 their }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid14443635

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They went upstairs. The stranger was sleeping when they looked into the room, but the slight noise they made awakened him and he gazed at them dully.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Feeling better?" J\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oe asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, yes," replied the stranger weakly. "I must have lost a lot of blood, though."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That was when they shot at you just before the boat blew up," said Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man in the bed nodded, but said nothing.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How come you to be in such a mess as this?" he asked, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 at last. "What were they shootin}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid1519798 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 g}{

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Jones shook his head stubbornly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I can't explain anything about it. Please go away. Let me sleep."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe signaled to the farmer that\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  it would be best if they withdrew, so they left the room and closed the door. 'When they went back downstairs the farmer was grumbling to himself.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm hanged if he ain't the most close-mouthed lad I've ever seen!" he declared. "You saved his life and he \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He must have some good reason. It's his own business, after all," reflected Frank. "We can't force him to explain anything."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy was deeply interested.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's only one theory I can think of," he said, at last. "This Jones, or whatever \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy smiled. "Not yet. That information, I thought I would keep to myself for the time being. But I wonder if Snackley can be here. It begins to look like it. He \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
is the kind who wouldn't stop at anything from kidnapping to murder."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do the authorities suspect him of being around here?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I imagine so. The man I was talking to mentioned the fact that the smugglers they are after are in the drug line. And Snackley is \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 king of the dope smugglers on the Atlantic coast."

boys had told of the escapade, but although they momentarily expected that some practical jester would come forward and take credit for the whole affair, nothing of the sort happened, and when noon came it was as much a mystery as ever.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm beginning to t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It might be only a coincidence. But when you come to think of it, that house on the cliff would be a mi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Gosh, I never thought of that! I wonder what dad thinks of it."

But when they returned home for lunch they found that Fenton Hardy had not come back. Neither was he at home when school closed for the day; and when the Hardy boys went to bed that night there had not been the slightest word from their father nor any 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 indication of where he had gone. In spite of the fact that they were accustomed to these sudden absences, the lada felt vaguely uneasy.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I've been \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 feeling that way myself. Of course, dad has often gone away from home like this without telling where he was going, and he has always turned up all right. But this time-"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mrs. Hardy, however, was not alarmed.

 reassuringly. "You boys are just anxious to get to work on the Snackley case. Perhaps that's what he's working on now, he'll probably come back with a lot of information."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'd rather he'd let us in on that," returned Joe.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 So the Hardy boys had to make the best of it. They concealed their impatience during the remainder of the week, doing their school work faithfully. The following week \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But on Friday afternoon the mystery of their father's absence took a strange turn.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They came back from schoo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 l to find their mother sitting in the living room, carefully examining a note that she had evidently just received.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Come here, boys," she said, as they came into the room. "I want you to look at this and 'tell me what y\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ou think of it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 She handed the note over to Frank.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's supposed to be."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardy boys read the note. It was written in pencil on a torn sheet of paper and the handwriting seemed to }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid13250592 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 be}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was signed by the detective. That was all. There was nothing to indicate where he was, nothing to show when the note had been written.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "When did you get this?" asked Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It came in \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the afternoon mail. It was addressed to me, and the envelope had a Bayport postmark."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What is there to worry about?" Joe asked. "It's better than not hearing from him at all."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But I'm not sure that it's from him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank snatched up the note again.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mrs. Hardy was plainly worried.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If he didn't write it, then who did?" asked Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Your father has many enemies. There \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
are relatives of criminals whom he has had arrested and there are criminals who have served their terms and have been released. If there has been foul play the note might be meant to keep us from being suspicious and delay any search."

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 been on their routes at that time, but the further they pursued their inquiries the deeper the mystery became.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why didn't we think of searching there before! Dad put two and two together and figured that there might be some connection between the queer things that happened at the Polucca place the day we visited it and the case

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Before they left, Frank explained the situation fully to the others.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The three motorcycles went out of Bayport past the Tower Mansion, sped along the shore road. There was little talk among the boys. Each realized that this was not a pleasure outing but a serious mission and each recognized t
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
he importance of it. The Hardy boys had every confidence in their companions. Chet and Biff, they knew, would not be as easily frightened on this occasion, and as for Phil and Tony, they were noted at school for their fearless, at times even reckless, dis

They passed the Kane farmhouse, nestling among the trees, and at last came in sight of the gloomy cliff that rose from Barmet Bay and at the summit of which perched the rambling stone house where the miser, Felix Polucca, had met his death.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Phil looked with interest at the old gray Louse th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
at could be seen more clearly now that they were approaching it. When they were still some distance from the lane, however, Frank brought his motorcycle to a stop and signaled to the others to do likewise.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's the idea?" Chet asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'd better sneak \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
up on the place quietly. If we go any farther they'll hear the motorcycles-that is, if there is any one at the place. We'll leave them here under the trees and go ahead on foot."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The motorcycles were accordingly hidden in a clump of bushes beside the road \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 and the six boys went on toward the lane.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll separate here," Frank decided. "Three of us will take one side of the lane and the rest will take the other side. Keep to the bushes as much as possible and when we get near the house lay low for a while and
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  watch the place. When I whistle we can come out from under cover and go on up to the house."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' That's a good plan,'' approved Tony. *' Joe and Biff and I, we'll go on the left side of the road."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 . Chet and Phil and I will take the other side. Remember to keep out of sight of the house as much as possible."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys entered the lane, then separated according to the agreement they had made. One group plunged into the weeds and undergrowth at the edg\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e of the lane on one side while the others pushed into the bushes at the opposite side. In a few minutes each group was lost to view and only an occasional snapping and crackling of branches indicated their presence in the heavy undergrowth that flanked t
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e lane.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Frank advanced cautiously. The brushwood was much deeper than he had anticipated and they made slow progress, for he was desirous of creeping up on the house with as little noise as possible. The undergrowth was thick and hampered their movements. 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They made their way forward, step by step, keeping well in from the lane, and after about ten minutes Frank raised his hand as a warning to the others.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Through the dense thickets he had caught a glimpse of the house.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They went on cautiously until they reac\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hed the edge of the bushes and there they crouched behind the screen of leaves, peeping out at the gloomy old stone building in the clearing.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But at the first glance, an expression of surprise crossed Frank's face.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 96           The House on ffi'e Cliff
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Polucca house was evidently occupied!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The weeds that had overgrown the yard on their last visit had been completely cleared away, the grass had been cut and the tumbledown fence had been repaired. The gate, which had been hanging by one hinge, had been fi
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 xed and the grass along the pathway had been trimmed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A similar change had overtaken the house.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was glass in all the windows and the boards had been removed. The front door had been repaired and the steps had been mended. Smoke was rising from the ki\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 tchen chimney.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There must be some one living here," whispered Chet.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank was puzzled.

 He had not heard that any one had taken the Polucca house. On account of the unenviable fame of the place it was hardly likely that a new tenant could move in without\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 arousing considerable comment in Bayport. But this had evidently happened.

hes, and these she began hanging up on the line. Shortly afterward a man came out, strode across the yard to the woodshed and began chopping wood.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys looked at one another in consternation.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They had expected to find \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the same sinister and deserted place they had visited previously. Instead, they had arrived on a scene of domestic peace and comfort. They could not understand it.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not much use staying in hiding," whispered Frank. "Let's get together and walk right up and\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  question these people."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He gave a low whistle, then emerged from the bushes into the lane. His companions followed. In a short time they were joined by Joe tind the other boys.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 All were deeply puzzled by the remarkable change that had come over the Polucc\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 a place.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"This beats anything I ever heard of," declared Joe. "It looks as if some farmer has taken the place, but it's queer we hadn't heard of it. Everybody in Bayport would be talking about it if they knew some one had nerve enough to take over the Polu

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 " I 'm not satisfied yet,'' Frank said. " We 11 go up and question these people."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Accordingly, the six boys walked boldly out of the lane and across the yard. The man in the woodshed saw them first and put down his axe, staring at them with an e\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

 demanded the man, emerging from the woodshed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He was short and thin with close-cropped hair, and he was in need of a shave. His complexion was swarthy a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At the same time another man came out of the kitchen and stood on the steps. He was stout and red-haired and had a thick mustache. As he stood the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yeah, what's the big idea?" he asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We didn't know any one was living here," explained Frank, edging over to the kitchen door. He wanted to get a look inside the house if possible.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 there is," said the red-haired man. "We're livin' here now, and I can't see that it's any of your business. What are you snooping around here for?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We aren't snooping," said Frank quietly. "We are looking for a man who has disappeared from Bayport."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hump\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 h!" grunted the woman.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What makes you think he might be around here?" asked the red headed man.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He was last seen in this neighborhood."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's his name?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What does he look like?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Tall and dark. He was wearin\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 g a grey suit and a grey cap."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Ain't been nobody around here since we moved in," said the red-headed man gruffly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No, we didn't see him," snapped the woman. "You boys had better go and look somewhere else."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was nothing to be gained by arguing with \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
the unsociable trio, so the boys started to leave. But Frank, who had edged close to the open door during the course of the conversation, had glanced into the kitchen and some thing had caught his eye.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 On the lower edge of the cap were\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  three large stains, reddish in color. They could have been made by nothing but blood.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In a daze, Frank turned on the water, filled the dipper and drank. At last he turned away, conscious that Bedhead had been eyeing him carefully all the time.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You might as well," snapped the woman. "There's been no strangers around here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We're sorry we troubled you," said Joe. "Good-bye."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 102         The House on the Cliff
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Bedhead grunted a curt farewell. The woman and the othe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you know why I went into the kitchen!'* he asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why?" they demanded eagerly, and Joe put in:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I thought there was something fishy about the way you asked for that drink. What did you see!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I saw dad's cap hanging on a peg!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 This caused an immediate sensation. Phil Cohen whistled in amazement.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Are you sure it was dad's cap?" asked Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Positive. I'd recognize it anywhere. And more than that, there were bloodstains on it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Bloodstains!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank nodded.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This is serio\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 us," declared Joe finally. "We can't let them get away with this."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 think we'd better go back and tell them we saw that cap and ask how it got there. That'll force a showdown. They don't like us any too well as it is, so we won't have to be over polite to them."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys held a council, and it was unanimously agreed that \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
the matter should not be dropped. Each was of the opinion that the trio now occupying the house on the cliff were far from savory and that the fact of Fenton Hardy's cap being seen in the kitchen was a clue of first-rate importance.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What do you want now?" demanded Redhead, in a surly manner, as he advanced.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We want to know about that cap in the kitchen," said Frank firmly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What cap?   There's no cap in there."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There isn't now-but there was. It's a grey cap and it was h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 anging in there when I went in for a drink."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I know the cap he means," he said. "It's mine. What about it?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It isn't yours, and you know it," declared Frank. "That cap belongs to the man we're looking for."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yon found it?" a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 sked Frank incredulously.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Sure, I found it. A grey cap-with bloodstains on it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's the one. But why did you hide it \bullet when I went into the kitchen?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, to tell the truth, them bloodstains made me nervous. I didn 't know but what there might be som\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e trouble come of it, so I thought I'd better keep that cap out of sight."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where did you find it?" Joe demanded.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "On the shore roa'l?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "When was this?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A couple of days ago-j\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ust after we moved inhere."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's see the cap," suggested Chet Morton. "We want to make sure of this."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Bedhead moved reluctantly toward the kitchen. The woman sniffed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't see why you're makin* all this fuss about an old cap," she said. "Comin' aroun\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d at this hour of the day disturbin' honest folk."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Redhead emerged from the house holding the cap in one hand. He tossed it over to the boys. They examined it eagerly.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't like the look of those bloodstains," said Joe, i\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n a low voice. "He must have heen badly hurt."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 To tell the truth, the inside of the cap gave evidence that the wearer had been severely injured, for the bloodstains were of large extent. The boys examined them gravely.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Are you sure you found this on the r\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oad!" Frank asked doubtfully.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We can't very well contradict you. I don't mind telling you that we're going to turn this over to the police. This man has disappeared, and by the appearance of this cap he has met \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
with foul play. If you know anything about it you'd better speak up now/'
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He doesn't know anything about it," shrilled the woman angrily. "Go away and don't bother us. Didn't he tell you he found the cap on the road ? Why should he know any-thin' more abo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We're going to take the cap with us."

of remarking, "if you put both their brains to-'gether you'd have enough for a half-wit."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't think it would do much good," said Frank. "But it wouldn't do any harm either. Collig might be able to throw a scare into them, anyway, if he went up to that\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 house and began asking questions."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 > The boys, therefore, trooped down to the police station and, after stating their business to the desk sergeant, were admitted to the chief's private office. They found Chief Collig and Detective Smuff deep in a game of
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  checkers.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's your move, Smuff," said the chief. "What is it, boys?" he demanded, looking up.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm doggone sure I won't go up alone," declared Smuff.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, as long as we're sur\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e you'll investigate, we won't say anything to the newspapers," said Frank, and Chief Collig breathed a sigh of relief.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's fine. That's fine,"he said. "Smuff and me, we'll go up there first thing to-morrow morning and if we find out anything we'll let\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  you know."

But although Chief Collig and Detective Smuff duly departed from Bayport the next morning in an exceptionally noisy and decrepit flivver, with Smuff perched nervously at the wheel, they returned before noon with the news that they had been able
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  to discover nothing further regarding Fenton Hardy. They had, they said, called at the house, but the people there had given a reasonable explanation as to the finding of the cap.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Eeal nice people, they were too," added CEief Collig. "The man said he fou\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nd the cap on the road, and why should he tell a lie about it! So Smuff and me, we came away."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A Plan of Attack              113
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes," agreed Smuff profoundly, "we came away."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "In a hurry," suggested Joe sarcastically.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Collig and Smuft looked uncomfortabl\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e. To tell the truth they had been so impressed by the fearful stories they had heard of the house on the cliff that they had stayed no longer than was necessary. They had merely asked a few perfunctory questions of Bedhead, had received his explanation o
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 f\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the finding of the cap., and had then hastened from the farm as quickly as was consistent with dignity.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We've done our duty," declared Chief Collig. "No man can do more."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 And with that the boys had to be content.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But they were not satisfied
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's some\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  connection between this smuggling outfit and the house on the cliff," declared Frank. "This man Snackley is mixed up in all this, I'm sure."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Didn't mother say he was related to Felix Polucca!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes-and isn't it likely that he inherited the Polucca farm a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 fter the old miser died? Perhaps that's what encouraged him to mov* his smuggling operations here."                     ;
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Perhaps Snackley was one of the two men we saw at the farm."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I wouldn't be surprised," said Frank, "But what I'm thinking of is this\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 -where did

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 " There might be.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 Look at it this way. Snackley was the man who "got" Jones that day, as he said. Snackley was related to Polucca, and may now own the farm. Snackley has been smuggling in Barmet Bay from some base that the government men have been unable to find. Perhaps

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Gosh, Frank, it sounds reasonable!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And perhaps that explains why the kidnappers got away with J\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys got into the motorboat, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 which was a rangy, powerful craft with graceful lines, and the engine was soon roaring. The boat, which was called the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was already late in the afternoon. The sky was overcast and the bay was rough. The salt spray dashed over the bows of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid14443635 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Tony steered the boat closer in toward the shore so that it would not be visible from the Polucca place. Then he slackened speed so that the roar of the engine would not be so noticeable, and the craft made its way alo

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was scarred and seamed and at the base had been eaten away by the battering of the waves. Time passed, and there was no indication of a path and the lads were disappointed.'
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The cliff jutted up out of very deep water and rose to a great height\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
. From the boat they were unable to see the Polucca place, for it was set in a short distance from the edge of the cliff. The face of the steep rock was uncompromising* JThere seemed to be no foothold for man or

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's the matter?" they ask\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed, in alarm.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But Tony was gazing fixedly ahead. He was tense and alert. Another shift of the wheel and the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid14443635 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Napoli }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then the Hardy boys saw the danger.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There were rocks at the base of the cliff. One of them, black and sharp, like an ugly toot\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
h, jutted out of the water almost immediately at the side of the boat. Only Tony's quick eye had saved them from striking against it. They had blundered into a veritable maze of reefs which extended for several yards ahead.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They held their breath.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It seeme\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
d impossible that they could run the gauntlet of those rocks without tearing the bottom out of the craft. But Tony's steermanship was marvelous. The motorboat threaded it$ .way accurately among the jutting rocks. There was always the chance that a submerg

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 120        The House on the Cliff
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Tony sank back with a sigh of relief.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "W\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hew, that was close!" he exclaimed. "I 'didn't see those rocks until we were right on top of them. If we'd ever struck one of them we would have been goners."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardy boys believed him. Angry waves dashed against the base of the cliff. They would not hav\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly, before them, they saw an opening in the side of the cliff. It was a long, narrow cove.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The entrance was like the ne\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here's a find!" exclaimed Frank, in excitement. "Let's turn back and see where this goes to."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Tony swung the boat around and the craft slowly made its way back toward the hidden cove. Soon the opening in the cliff came into view again.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But the cove proved uninteresting. The\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 sides were steep, although dense bushes grew about the base of the slopes, but there was no path, no trail, no indication that any human being had ever been in the place. Being protected from the wind, the water was calm. The echoes of the motorboat's en

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He was standing there quietly, gazing at them without a shadow of expression on his sinister 'face, as motionless as a statue.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When he saw that he was observed he called out:

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Tony \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 throttled down the engine. The three boys stared at the man in the black hat as though he were an apparition.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Leave this place!" he repeated, in a curiously metallic voice.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We aren't doing any harm," replied Frank.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys hesitated. As though to emphasize his commands, the man in the black hat reached suddenly into his pocket and whipped out \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
a wicked-looking revolver. Then he folded his arms, tapping the barrel of the revolver against one shoulder very deliberately.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Turn that boat around and get out of here!" he snapped. "Don't come back. Don't ever come back. Don't ever try to land here. Thi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s is private property. If you ever }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But how do they get to the house if you think they have anything to do with the Polucca place ?'' asked Tony. '' Those cliff\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s in there are mighty steep."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Tony became infected with the enthusiasm of the Hardy boys and he readily agreed to keep the motorboat in \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

The motorboat went some distance down the shore and then they turned and, keeping well out in the bay, went on up past the cliff once again. They kept a sharp eye on the location of the cove, and in spite of the fact that they knew just where it was th

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No wonder the place hasn't been heard of more often!" Frank said. "It looks like an unbroken wall of rock from this far out."

Although they cruised around for more than an hour, they saw not the slightest sign of life either about the base of the cliff or on the Polucca place, which, keeping well out from shore as they did, they could plainly distinguish. As the gloom deepened t
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ey felt that it was almost useless to continue, but Frank decided that they should wait a while longer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "These fellows aren't likely to move around much in daylight. Night is the time for their operations," he pointed out. "We'll hang around for a while lo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nger."

Twilight deepened into darkness and the lights of Bayport could be seen as a yellow haze through the mist at the distant extremity of the bay. The cliff was but a dark smudge in the night and the waves broke against the rocks with a lonely sound.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Su\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ddenly, through the darkness, they heard a muffled sound. Their own boat was runniug along quietly and they listened.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Another boat," remarked Tony, in a whisper.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was, indeed, another motorboat, and it was near the base of the cliff. At last they could \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 distinguish a faint light, and toward this light they began to move slowly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They were tense with excitement. Everything might depend on the events of the next few minutes.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 128         The House on the Cliff
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When they had gone in toward the cliff as far as \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
they dared, creeping up from the west, they could make out the gloomy outline of the other motorboat, which was making its way slowly out of the very face of the cliff itself.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At first they could not imagine how the craft had got in so close nor where it w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
as coming from. They crept up closer, at imminent danger of discovery, and at imminent danger of being washed ashore on the rocks. Then, finally, they heard the other boat slow down, heard the faint clatter of oars, then voices.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 After that, with an abrupt \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
roar that startled them, the other motorboat suddenly plunged on out into the bay. They could hear it threshing on its way out toward sea at an ever-increasing rate of speed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where is it going!" said Tony, in amazement.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank cautioned for silence.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 's a rowboat around here," he whispered. "Lay low."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They waited in silence and at last they heard the rattle of oars again.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 This time the sound was closer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The rowboat was drawing near.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fortunately the wind was from the sea and it blew the sounds toward th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 em, at the same time keeping the men in the boat from hearing the muffled murmur of their own craft.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The rattle of oars continued and at last the 1)oys could see the dim shape of the boat through the gloom. Finally they cou\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ld distinguish the words of the dark figures in the craft. At a sign from Frank Tony cut off the engine for the time being.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But they could not make out complete sentences. The wind would whisk toward them a fragment of speech and then the rest of the words\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  would be drowned.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "-three hundred pounds-" they heard a harsh voice saying, and then the rest of the sentence was lost.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No, we mustn't forget that," they heard a gruff voice reply.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I hope they get away all right."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What are you worrying about? Of course they'll get away."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm worried. I've got a hunch that we'd better clear out of here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Clear out!" replied the other contemptuously. "Are you crazy? Why, this place is as safe as a church. We can make a big clean-up before they know we're in this part of the country at \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 all."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, maybe you're right," said the first man doubtfully. "But still-"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His voice died away as the boat went on into the cove.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys could hear the rattle of oars and then a dull swishing of bushes, a muttered voice, and then silence fell.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boy\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s looked at one another through the gloom.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Smugglers!" exclaimed Frank.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But Tony demurred, though as he spok\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e he started up the engine again.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 This phase of the matter had not occurred to the Hardy boys, but they saw that it was reasonable. In the darkness it would \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
be risky entering the narrow passage to the cove and then, as Tony said, it was probable that their approach would be heard.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No; I have it in a waterproof case. We can feel our way around these rocks until we get into the cove."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Cautiously, the boys made their way along the tre\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
acherous rocks. Once Joe lost his footing and slipped into the water with a splash. Instantly both boys remained motionless, fearing the sound had attracted the attention of the men in the cove. But there was not a sound.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe was ankle-deep in water, but h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e clambered up on the rocks again and they continued their journey.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They had landed at a point some twenty-five yards away from the entrance to the cove, but the rocks were so treacherous and the journey

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 was so difficult that the distance seemed much longer.

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 whispered Frank, as they went on through the night. "Didn't you hear one of those men use a Chinese name?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He said something about Li Chang's share."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Li\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 Chang is probably the fellow who brings the dope to the coast. They bring the stuff into this cove by motorboat and rowboat and it is distributed from here. Dad said Snackley was smuggling dope."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It must have been Snackley who ordered us away from here. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He seemed like a leader of some kind."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Five thousand dollars reward if we lay our hands on him I"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They had now reached the place where the seemingly solid coast line was broken by the indentation of the cove. They had feared that the cliff might be too st\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
eep at this point, but they found that it sloped gradually to the water and that there was a narrow ledge on which they could walk, one behind the other.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Here, they realized, the dangerous part of the adventure began.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was very lonely in the shadow of th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e steep cliffs, and the loneliness was intensified by the distant moaning of the surf and the beat anoi

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 wash of the waves against the reefs. Far in the distance they could see the reflection of the lights of Bayport throu\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
gh the mist and once or twice they could hear the murmur of Tony's motorboat as it sped away down the bay.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I hope they bring back lights and guns with them," muttered Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Who?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The police."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't worry. If they get word that Snack-ley is cornered th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ey'll send out a squad of militia."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys rounded the point and began to make their way directly along the shore of the cove. Dense thickets and bushes grew right to the water's edge and the boys were afraid of making too much noise, as they realized th
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 at the two men they had heard talking in the boat might be close by-perhaps even waiting to pounce upon them in the darkness.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Their hearts beat quickly with the knowledge of the risk they were running, but neither lad thought of turning back. They were not\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 thinking of the smugglers alone-they were thinking of their father.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When they reached the first of the thickets they paused. They knew that the crackling of the branches would betray their whereabouts if there was any one within hearing distance. For a wh\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ile they did not know just what to do.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Secret Passage            13?
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then Frank began to lower himself from the rock on which he was standing into the water.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If it isn't too deep we can wade around," he whispered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The water, fortunately, was shallow, and \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 did not come up to his knees. He signaled to Joe to follow, and Joe accordingly slipped quietly down into the water heside him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then, without a word and moving as slowly as possible, Frank went on, wading through the water, close to the outstretched branch\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 es that overhung the shore.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
It seemed as though they were wading at the bottom of a deep pit, for the high walls of rock ranged all about them and after they had penetrated into the cove some little distance the entrance was lost to view, being hidden by a
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n angle of the cliffs. When they looked up they could see the gloomy greyness of the night sky above.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The cove was still in deep silence, so finally Frank concluded that the men who had entered the place in the boat had retired to some secret biding place.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 Inasmuch as they could not hope to discover anything without a light, he withdrew the flashlight from its case, and then switched it on.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The yellow beam of light revealed\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the pallid leaves of the bushes by the shore and the naked walls of rock above. But although Frank

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 turned the flashlight in every direction about the cove there was no sign of the rowboat in which the two men had arrive\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It had vanished utterly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Although the lads were prepared for the disappearance of the smugglers, they were not prepared for the disappearance of the rowboat. But they searched for it in vain. The light revealed nothing of the craft.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I wonder where they\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  hid it!" whispered Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
They began a systematic search of the bushes around the cove, remaining as quiet as possible, but although they made almost a tour of the place it was soon evident that the boat had not been beached under cover of any of the thic
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 kets.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It must be hidden in a cave of some kind," Frank decided at last. "And that's where the smugglers are."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Once again they began a search of the bushes.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They were still wading in the water and their feet were now very cold, but they searched patiently \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
and carefully, brushing aside the branches, peering into the bushes, but it seemed they were to find nothing but the uncompromising rocks and moss beyond.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At last, however, as they were approaching a part of the cove which they had not visited before, Fran\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 k, who was in the lead, stumbled suddenly forward. His groping feet had failed

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With great presence of mind, he kept the .searchlight high in the air. He had stepped into a d\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
eep hole, and although he was up to his neck in water he kept his arm raised, keeping the flashlight free of the wetness.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here! Take the light," he gasped, in a lioarse whisper.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe leaned over and grasped the flashlight.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Deep water here," muttered Frank\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , as he tried to scramble back into the shallows.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But the hole into which he had fallen was a sudden drop and it was necessary for Joe to grasp his brother's outstretched hand before he could regain the shallow water. At length, soaked to the skin, Frank a
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 gain stood beside his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good thing it wasn't any deeper," he remarked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The bottom is pretty level around here. It's funny there should be a deep hole like that."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank gave a sudden exclamation.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I know how that came to be there," he whispered. "T\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hat's a^channel! See how close it is to the shore. The water shouldn't be so deep right there."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why should it be a channel?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He played the flashlight on the surface of the water and then they could see clearly that the bottom of the cove was broken by a deep channel at that point, several feet in width, leading directly t
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oward a clump of bushes at the shore.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Keeping well to the side of the channel and in the shallow water, the Hardy boys made their way over to the bushse.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then, when the beam of the flashlight was cast on the dense covert of branches, the mystery was clear.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Beyond the bushes was a dark opening in the rock.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A cave I" exclaimed Frank, in a suppressed tone.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was so cleverly concealed that it could not have been seen in the clear light of the day ex-nept at close quarters. The glare of the flashlight, however\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
, cast the dark opening into prominence behind the screen of leaves.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 This, then, was the explanation of the boat's disappearance. There was a channel in the cove enabling the smugglers to row the boat directly into this cave in the rock. This also probably\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 explained the presence of the motorboat.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They went in here," said Joe.                   (

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Having gone so far, there was no going back. The boys were fully determined to keep on the track of the smugg\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
lers. They did not know what lay behind the darkness of that silent and mysterious opening in the rock. But they meant to find out, no matter what the risks.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Cautiously, they advanced into the bushes, which gave way protestingly before them. The branches w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
hipped their faces. The water was still shallow, for there was a narrow ledge along the side of the channel and, moreover, it was now low tide.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At last the bushes closed behind them. The Hardy boys were standing in the entrance to a secret passage, pressed\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  close against the rocky wall of the cave.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The beam illuminated the depths of the dark passage. Far ahead of the brothers they glimpsed a grey shape just above the surface of the glisten\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ing water.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
For a moment they were startled, then they recognized that the grey shape was nothing more than the rowboat that had passed by them in the darkness outside the cove. It had been drawn up close to a natural wharf hewn out of the solid rock. It sw
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ayed to and fro with the motion of the water.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys made their way forward along the! ledge, which was wide enough for one person to walk on, until at last the ledge widened out and proved to be a path leading to the wharf.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was not a sound in the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 passage but the drip-drip of water from the gloomy walls.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardy boys stole quietly forward along the wharf, passed the boat, and then looked about them.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank played the beam of the flashlight all about the place un\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 til at last the glare revealed a dark opening immediately ahead.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was a crude arch in the rock and beyond it he could see a steep flight of wooden steps.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His heart was pounding with excitement. There was no doubt now that they had discovered the smuggler\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s' secret.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We've found it," he whispered to Joe. "We've found the passage. This must be directly underneath the house on the cliff."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll have to go quietly."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The light cast strange shadows through the gloomy passage in the rocks. Water dripped from the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 walls. Water dripped from their clothing. They tiptoed quietly forward beneath the archway until they reached the flight of steps.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then, quietly, almost stealthily, they began to ascend.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The place was in a deathlike silence. It was as if they were in a tomb. So quiet was the strange stairway in the cliff that the boys could hardly believe that men had been there but a short while before.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Step by step they ascended the stairs, and at last F\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
rank's flashlight showed that they were approaching a door. It was set directly in a frame in the wall of rock at which the stairs ended. The passageway curved above them in a rocky ceiling.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They stood on the steps outsi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 de the door.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Should they enter?
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They did not know what lay beyond. They might be entering the very haunt of the smugglers. In fact, this was most probable. And in that event they would not have a chance of escape.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For a while they remained there, not knowi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ng whether to retreat or go on.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then Frank stepped forward. He pressed his ear against the door and listened intently.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was not a sound.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He peered around the sides of the door to see if he could catch a glimpse of light. There was only darkness. At le\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ngth he decided that there was no one immediately beyond the door and he made up his mind to go ahead.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He whispered his decision to Joe, who nodded.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm with you."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The door was opened by a latch, and Frank tried it cautiously. At first it was obstinate.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They did not immediately cross the threshold. Perhaps their approach had been \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 heard. Perhaps the smugglers lay in wait for them beyond. So they remained there in silence for,
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Chamber in tlie Cliff        145
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 several minutes, listening for the  slightest sound.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 However, it became apparent that the dark chamber was empty, so Frank\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  switched on the flashlight.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
The vivid beam cut the darkness and revealed a gloomy cave in the very center of the cliff, hewn out of the rock. It had been a natural cave, just as the tunnel in the cliff had been a natural passageway, but the roof had oeen 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 bolstered up by great beams and the sides had been chipped away while the floor had been leveled. It was a secret chamber in the heart of the rock.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The light revealed the fact that this chamber was used as a storeroom, for there were huge boxes, bales and \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 packages distributed about the floor and piled against the walls.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Smuggled goods!" exclaimed Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His suspicions seemed verified by the fact that the majority of the boxes bore labels of foreign countries. Chinese characters were scribbled across them i\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n practically every case.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Seeing that the chamber was unoccupied, the boys stepped through the doorway and looked about them. The flashlight illuminated the murky corners of the cave.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This must be where they store all the stuff," Joe said, as he inscected\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  one of the boxes.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There must be another opening that leads to the top of the cliff. They probably bring the stuff up to the house and then dispose of it from there."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"You'd think they would keep it at the Polucca place instead of down here." ' "Probably they are afraid the house might be raided at some time or another. That's why they keep the goods hidden in this place. It would be mighty hard for any one to find it

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But how do they get the stuff out of here? There's no doorway that I can see."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The light of the flashlight played upon the walls.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 No doorway, no opening of any kind, was revealed.
\par \loch\af1\dbch\af31505\hich\f1 \'ab\loch\f1 \hich\f1 ' That's strange,'' said Frank. \'ab\loch\f1 ' There must be some way out."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 began to move about the chamber. Across some of the bales of goods had been thrown rich bolts of silk, while valuable tapestries were also lying carelessly on the floor. In one corner were three or four boxes piled on top of one another. Frank accidental
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 l\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 y knocked the flashlight against one of these and it gave forth a hollow sound.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's empty," he said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 An idea struck him that perhaps these boxes had been piled up to conceal some passage lead-
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Chamber In the Cliff        147
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ing out of the secret cha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 mber. He mentioned his suspicion to Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But how could they pile the boxes up there after they went out?" his brother questioned.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This gang are smart enough for anything. Let's move these boxes away."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He seized the topmost box. It was very light and he r\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 emoved it from the top of the pile without difficulty.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I thought so!" exclaimed Frank, with satisfaction.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For the light revealed the top of a door which had hitherto been hidden from view.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys lost no time in moving the rest of the boxes, and the ent\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ire door was soon in sight. Then the boys discovered how it was possible for the boxes to be piled up in such a position in spite of the fact that the smugglers had left the chamber and closed the door behind them.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Attached to the bottom of the door was a \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 small wooden platform that projected out some distance over the floor of the cave and on this iplatf orm the boxes had been piled.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They are kept there all the time, as a blind," he said. "Whenever any one leaves the cave and closes the door the boxes swin\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The ingenuity of the contrivance won their reluctant admiration,

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What shall we do!" asked Joe, looking through the doorway into the darkn\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ess beyond. "Go ahead?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We've come this far, and there's no sense in turning back. Let's go."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank stepped on into the passage beyond. He had hardly switched on the flashlight, revealing a crude flight of stairs that led from the rocky landing, before he\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 stiffened and laid a warning hand on his brother's arm.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Voices!" he whispered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They listened.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They heard a man's voice in the distance. They could not distinguish what he was saying, for he was still too far away, but gradually the tones grew louder. The\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
n, to their alarm, they heard footsteps.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Hastily, they retreated into the secret chamber.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Quick!   The door," snapped Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They closed the door quietly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '' Now the boxes. If they come in here they'fl notice that the boxes have been moved. Quick."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Swiftly the Hardy boys began to pile the empty boxes back on the platform that projected from the bottom of the door. They worked as quietly as possible and as they worked they heard the footsteps on the stairs drawing closer and closer.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Out the other door."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They sped across the floor of the chamber toward the door that led to the stairs they had just recently ascended, but hardly had they reached it before they heard a rattle at th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We haven't time," whispered Frank. "Hide."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The beam of the flashlight revealed a number of boxes close by the door. Over these boxes had been thrown a heavy bolt of silk, the folds of which hung down t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
o the floor. They scrambled swiftly in behind the boxes, pressing themselves close against the wall. They did not have more than time to hide themselves and switch out the light before they heard the other door open.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's a package of dope in that ship\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Eight," they heard some one else reply. "Anything else to go up?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No. We won't \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 start moving the rest of this until the end of the week. It's too dangerous. Let Burke take out the shipment he has, along with this dope, and then we'll lay low

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The strong electric light th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 To the relief of the boys the man turned away and went back to the other side of the chamber. They could hear a rustling sound. Then came the words:

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The switch snapped and the cavern was steeped in darkness immed\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
iately. It was a darkness immeasurably welcome to the lads crouched behind the boxes. They began to breathe more easily. They heard the door close and then they could hear the footsteps of the two men as they ascended the stairs in the passageway.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  footsteps could be heard no more, Frank switched on the flashlight with a sigh of relief.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They crossed the chamber and again opened the door. Cautiously, they stepped out on the landing, closed the door behind them, and again confronted the flight of steps.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll go first," said Frank. "Stick close be-hind me."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He decided to turn out the flashlight, because it was barely possible that the smugglers might have a guard at the top of the stairs, in which event their approach would be discovered. So^ in the ink

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They reached the top of the first flight of stairs and then they found themselves upon a crude landing of planks which ran along the side of the rock wall for some distance until it ended in another flight of st

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Here the boys stopped again to listen. All was as silent as the tomb save for the distant pounding of the sea upon the cliff.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't hear a sound," whispered Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Come on," came from his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The passage through the rock was of considerable dep\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 th, and they went on up countless steps until their limbs were weary. They had

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 never realized that the cliff was so high until now.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But at length they reached the final landing and there they were confronted by another do\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
or. This door, they assumed, either led out Into the open or into some cave just below the surface of the ground. Perhaps, thought Frank, it even led into the cellar of the Polucca house.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys pressed close to the door, taking care to make no noise, an\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d listened.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They heard not a sound.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Still, with the caution arising from their previous narrow escape, they decided to wait a little while longer. As later events proved, it was well that they did.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For a while they could hear\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 nothing from beyond the door and there was no indication that any one -was there. But, after listening intently for as long as five minutes, they heard a queer shuffling sound and then a sigh. That was all.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Some one there t" breathed Frank, in a low whis\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 per.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe nodded in the darkness.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They did not know what to do. It seemed apparent that there was some one beyond the door. Possibly a sentry. If there was only one man it might be possible to attack him and disarm him, although it was scarcely possible tha

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The problem was solved for them.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A door thudded in the distance. Then there was a muffled murmur of voices, growing in volume, and\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  a trampling of feet.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I tell you this nonsense has gone far enough. He'll sign, and he'll sign right now, or I'll know the reason why."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys started. For the voice was none other than the voice of the man who had ordered them out of the cove that afte\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rnoon.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's the stuff, chief!" returned some one. "Make him sign and promise to keep his month shut."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was the sound \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
of a switch being snapped, and then the boys could see a yellow beam of light beneath the door at their feet. From the sounds they judged that three or four men had entered the room beyond.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, he's still here," said the man who had been addressed as "c\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A weary voice answered him. The tones were low. The boys could not. make out the wo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rda-

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wait till he goes hungry for a few days and then he'll think differently," put in one of the other men. There was a hoarse laugh from his companions.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, you'll be hungry enough before we're through with you. I can promis\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e you that,'* eaid the harsh voice. '' Are you going to sign t''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No," they heard the prisoner in the other room answer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Who was this man who was evidently held captive by the smugglers in the underground' room? The same thought was in the mind of each boy\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  as he listened to the conversation.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You know too much about us. You've found out too much, and we'll never let you get out of here to use your information. You may as well get that straight. You've read that paper. If you don't sign it you will starve."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The prisoner evidently did not reply.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You must trust me very much. What is to prevent me fr\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 om signing that paper and then going back on my word?" asked Fenton Hardy curiously.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We know you too well, Hardy. We know that if you signed that promise you would keep it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Exactly. And that is why I won't sign it, I wouldn't be doing my duty if I agreed to any scheme that would protect you."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was silence for a while. Then Fenton Hardy answe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 red slowly:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They would rather know that I died doing my duty than have me come back to them as a protector of smugglers and criminals."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You have a very high sense of duty," sneered Snackley. "But perhaps you'll think better of it after a while. Are you t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hirsty I"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy was left alone.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe made a sudden move toward the door, but Frank restrained him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not just yet," he cautioned. "They may have left some one to guard him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 So the boys waited, listening intently at the door.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But there were\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  no further sounds from within the room. At length, satisfied that his father had indeed been left alone, Frank fumbled for the latch of the door.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Noiselessly, he managed to open it. He pressed in on the door until it was open about an inch, then he peeped\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  through the aperture.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He found himself on the threshold of a sort of cellar, a damp and mouldy chamber, of
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 162         The House on the Cliff
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 about the same size as the storage room in the heart of the cliff, with the difference that whereas the first roo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
m was a cave in the rock, this place had been dug out of the earth. It was floored with planks and a lone electric light cast a yellowish illumination over the scene. There was a crude table and a few chairs, while in one corner stood a small camp-bed.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 On \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 this bed he spied his father.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Fenton Hardy was bound hand and foot to the cot, so tightly trussed up that he was unable to move more than a few inches in any direction. He was lying flat on his back, staring up at the muddy ceiling of his prison. On a chai
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 r beside the cot was a large sheet of paper, presumably the document the smugglers were asking him to sign.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective did not hear the door open. As Frank looked at him he was conscious of a change in the appearance of his father, a change that shocked\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 him extremely. For Fenton Hardy was thin and pale, his cheeks were sunken and he looked like a man who was famished for want of food.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank opened the door a little wider and tiptoed into the room. Joe followed quietly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They knew that there was danger of the smugglers returning at any moment. They knew that they must work swiftly and quietly

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 if they were to effect the release of their father.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A slight sound attracted Fenton Hardy's at-tenti\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
on and he slowly turned his head. When his gaze rested on the figures of the two boys who were stealing across the floor toward him he almost uttered an exclamation of amazement hut he managed to check the involuntary utterance, although his face lighted 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 u\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 p with re-Kef.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Quickly, the Hardy hoys reached his bed-side. Frank drew out his pocketknife and, without a word, without even a whisper, began to hack at the ropes that bound his father. But the knife was dull and the ropes were heavy.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe had lost his kni\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
fe in the water soon after they had left Bayport, and although he searched about the room, he was unable to find one, so he set himself to the laborious business of trying to untie the knots.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Every moment was precious. At any second, the boys knew, they mi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ght hear the footsteps of the approaching smugglers. They worked with frantic caution, working against time.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank hacked at the ropes, but the dull blade seemed to make little progress. Joe fumbled at the obstinate knots until his fingernails were broken,\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  but he could scarcely loosen the strands.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Minutes passed-slowly and agonizingly. Fenton Hardy could give no assistance. He

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 had to lie there in silence, not daring even to encourage the lads by a whisper. The silence was\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 broken only by the heavy breathing of the two boys, by the scarcely audible sound of the knife against the ropes.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At last the knife cut through one of the ropes and Fenton Hardy's feet were free. Frank pulled the ropes away, but a loose end fell on the fl\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oor with a light sound.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Slight as the noise was, it seemed to them almost deafening, in view of the necessity for silence. Desperately, Frank prepared to set to work to cut through the ropes that bound Fenton Hardy's arms. And, even as he reached over with
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the knife, they heard a sound that sent a thrill of terror through them.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was a heavy footstep beyond the door through which the smugglers had recently disappeared !
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Some one was approaching the underground room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank strained at the knife, but the rop\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
es were stubborn. The dull blade made little impression at first. But at last the rope began to give, and finally, as Fenton Hardy gave a mighty effort, it snapped, and the detective was free.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But the footsteps on the stairs had drawn nearer and it was fol\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 lowed by others. The smugglers were returning.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Quick!" whispered Prank, as he flung the ropes aside.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I-I can't-hurry!" gasped out Fenton Hardy. "I've been here too-too long." He could hardly utter the words. His face showe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d his exhaustion.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But we've got to hurry, dad!" came excitedly from Frank. '' See if you can't make it.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll-I'll do my-my best," returned his father.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If those fellows come back let's fight for it," put in Joe desperately.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You bet we'll fight," answe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 red Frank in a voice that meant a great deal.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy got to his feet as hastily as he could, but when he stood up on the floor he reeled and would have fallen had not Joe grasped his arm. He had been lying bound to the cot for so long and he was so w
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 eak from hunger that a fit of dizziness had attacked him. It soon passed, however, and the three hastened toward the door through which the Hardy boys had entered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But the smugglers were very close now. The Hardys could hear the coarse voices just outside \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the other door.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was no chance of escape.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not bad, "he muttered. "I hadn't thought of Li Chang. Yes, he'd be able to look after them. He'd see to it that they never returned," and he grinned griml\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 y.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He'd probably dump 'em overboard before they got to China at all," declared Ked-head smugly. "Li Chang doesn't like to feed passengers if they can be got rid of."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The chief of the smugglers stood in the center of the room for a while, contemplating his captives with a bitter smile. Then he turned suddenly on his heel.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Well, they're safe enough," he said to Redhead. "We have that business with Burke to at\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

 he left the room, followed by Bedhead and the other smugglers, with the exception of two who left >by the other door. Their footsteps could be heard as they went down the flight of stairs leading to the bottom of the cliff.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Malloy was not \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 bothering with the prisoners. He was not even looking in their direction. Instead, his head was already beginning to nodj, as though he were going to sleep.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Snackley had made a poor selection when he chose Malloy as guard. The man had been up the entire pr\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
evious night helping bring in the shipment of smuggled goods from Li Chang's vessel, and he had had no sleep that day. He was very tired. Sleep stole upon him without Ms being aware of it.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the meantime, Mr. Hardy was hnsy. He had profited by his previous experience.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When the smug\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
glers seized him and attempted to tie him to the bed for the second time he had made use of a trick frequently employed by magicians and professional "escape" artists, who guarantee to escape from ropes and strait-jackets. He had expanded his chest and he
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 l\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d his muscles rigid, keeping his arms as far away from his sides as possible, so that later, when he relaxed, he found that the ropes did not bind him as tightly as his captors had intended.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 This gave him a small leeway. He found that the ropes were especi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ally slack about his right wrist, so he began to work laboriously to free himself. For a long time he thought it would be impossible, and the rope chafed his wrist, but at last he managed to slide his hand free.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe and Frank watched this performance with \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
amazement, and new hope came into their eyes as they saw their father slowly groping for one of the knots. The detective fumbled at it for a while. It was slow work, for he had but one hand free, but in their haste the smugglers had not tied the knot as f

 feet. They had not been bound so securely, being simply tied down tinder one strand of rope about the cot, and after silently struggling for a few minutes he was able to work his way free.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective's next move was to take off his boots, which he did \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
swiftly and quietly, placing them noiselessly on the bed. Then he crept out onto the floor and began to steal over toward the guard.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Malloy was half asleep, but the detective had not gone more than two yards before a slight sound, a slight creaking of the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 floor, warned the jjuard that something was amiss.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He turned, blinking.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A look of intense amazement crossed Malloy's face and he opened his mouth to yell for help, but Fenton Hardy leaped across the intervening space and hurled himself upon the smuggler be\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He clapped one hand over Malloy's mouth and bore the guard to the floor, where they rolled over and over in a desperate and silent struggle. Although Fenton Hardy was weakened by his imprisonment a

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe and Frank watched the battle in an agony of suspense. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was, they knew, their last hope.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy still kept his hand over the other man's mouth, although Malloy was gasping and gurgling and making frantic efforts to call out for help. The detective dug his knee into Malloy's stomach and when the smuggle
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 r tried to wriggle out of the way he snatched for the revolver.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Their hands closed about the butt of the weapon at the same instant.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The struggle was short and bitter.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Malloy tugged at the revolver, trying to draw it from his pocket. Fenton Hardy dug his k\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
nee sharply against the man and Malloy loosened his grasp, with a groan of pain. The detective snatched the revolver free and then flung himself back, leveling the weapon at Malloy.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not a word out of you!" he whispered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Malloy's hands rose in the air. He \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 did not titter a sound. He was sitting helplessly on the floor, his mouth opening and closing as he painfully drew breath. He was beaten.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective spied a knife in a leather sheath at the smuggler's belt so he reached forward and seized the weapon.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The ropes on the bed had not been cut, so they were s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fortunately, the Hardy boys were not standing in the pa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
th of the shot. But the noise had attracted the attention of the smugglers outside the house, and in a few seconds the back 'door was flung open.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They're in here!" some one yelled. "They're in the house!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy flung to one side the man with whom h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e had been struggling.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Upstairs!" he called out to the two boys and ran on into the next room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A feeble light was burning, a candle standing in its own grease near the bottom of the staircase. Up these stairs they fled, Joe pausing long enough to extingui\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
sh the candle. The room was plunged into darkness just as the first of the smugglers rushed through the doorway.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy waited at the top of the stairs until the boys joined him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Somebody in the room below lit a match.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective fired directly at\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 the spluttering light. There was a muttered exclamation. The match was immediately extinguished by the smuggler who had been so incautious as to reveal his whereabouts in this manner. A whispered conversation followed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He's at the top of the stairs!" sai\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d one of the smugglers. "We can't rush him. He's cot a revolver,"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Only one!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes.   The kids aren't armed."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wait till he uses up his ammunition. Then we'll get him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was another whispered colloquy and then the sm\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ugglers apparently withdrew toward the doorway leading into the kitchen. Then, in a moment, a perfect fusillade of shots broke out.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But Fenton Hardy and the boys had withdrawn past the turn in the staircase and were well protected. They could hear the upro\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 \hich\f1 ar of gunfire as the smugglers riddled the stair\'bb
\loch\f1  case with bullets.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That should have finished 'em!" they could hear Snackley saying. "If they're on the stairs at all they're as dead as mutton by now."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Best be careful," muttered one of the men. "Hardy ha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s a gun."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where did he get it?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "From the guard.   They tied him up.'*
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Lucky they didn't get away altogether. Wait till I talk to Malloy!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He was tied fast to the bed when we came back up the stairs. They had taken his gun and gagged him. He said they h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ad just gone, so we made after them and came up through the trapdoor. They were just getting out of the shed when we saw 'em."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What a fine chase we would have had if they had got out into the woods. Well, we have 'em trapped now."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Whispers followed. The boys listened. Once they heard some one say:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The back stairs-"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank turned to his father.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They're going to rush us by the bao\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 k stairs!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I hadn't thought of that," said Mr. Hardy. "I wonder if there is any way of reaching the attic."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank took the flashlight from his pocket and switched it on. Just a few yards away he could distinguish a flight of stairs leading up to a trapdoo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
r in the ceiling. At the same time he could hear a stealthy noise at the bottom of another flight of steps that led to the kitchen.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hurry!" he whispered, and the three moved silently down the hall until they reached the steps.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe went up first and Frank \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 followed with the light, while Fenton Hardy stood at the bottom of the steps to cover their retreat with the revolver.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When Joe reached the trapdoor he pushed at it. At first it proved stubborn and would not open. There was an anxious moment while he strov\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e to force it open but in spite of all his efforts it would not budge.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 188         The House on the Cliff
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's the matter!" asked Frank from below.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It won't open."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank went on up the few remaining steps and added his efforts to those of his brother. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Together they shoved at the trapdoor, and at last it moved, then opened, falling back with a loud crash.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a yell from the stairs.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hurry up, men! They're getting into the attic."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A rush of thudding footsteps followed as the smugglers raced up the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
steps. Joe scrambled through the opening and Frank followed. Fenton Hardy was only half way up the steps, however, when the first smugglers reached the hallway. The detective fired directly at them.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The smugglers who were in the lead fell back in a despera\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
te attempt to reach cover, and in so doing they collided with those behind. For a few moments confusion prevailed, and Fenton Hardy took advantage of it to spring up the few remaining steps, scramble through the opening and fling the trapdoor back into pl

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys found themselves in the inky darkness of the attic. Frank switched on tka flashlight, and in its glare they saw that they were in a dusty chamber immediately below the loof. Old boxes and rubbish lay about
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Into the Haunted House         189
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where did they go?" they heard one of the smugglers ask.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Into the attic," replied another. "Now we've got them where we want them."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's what you said last time."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They can't get out of there. We.Ve got them cornered."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Snackley's voice broke in.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hard\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 y!" he shouted.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy did not answer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Listen, Hardy!" went on Snackley. "We'll give you one minute to come down out of there."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Still no answer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The floors are thin, Hardy I We can fire right through 'em. You can't get out. We have you cornered. Better come down."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank flashed the light from side to side. It was evident that the smuggler spoke the truth. They were indeed cornered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 An interval of \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 silence followed.   Then came:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Your last chance, Hardy!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank flashed the light upon his father. Mr. Hardy was inspecting the chamber of the revolver. He held out the weapon with a gesture of despair. There were no more shells.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A shot sounded from below \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 and a bullet ripped its way savagely through the flooring but a foot or so away from where the three sat.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 190          The House on the Cliff
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Another bullet tore through the wood of the trapdoor.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys sprang hack and, making aa little noise as possib\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 le, pressed themselves against the sloping walls of the attic, keeping as far away from the trapdoor as they could,
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A few more shots resounded. The bullets were unpleasantly close.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then Snackley spoke again.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What do you think of it now, Hardy? Are you and\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  your boys ready to come down?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They did not answer, for they knew that if they did their voices would reveal where they were standing and might bring a bullet. When they did not reply Snackley spoke to his men.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let 'em have a few more 1"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 An angry chorus \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
of revolver shots followed. In the midst of the uproar some of the smugglers secured a long pole and pushed against the trapdoor with it. Before those above could avert the danger the trapdoor was flung wide open. It fell back with a crash.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A hand appeared\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 through the trapdoor, holding a revolver, and then the head and shoulders of one of the smugglers followed. He peered into the darkness, holding the weapon in readiness. Some one had switched on a light in the ihall so that the man's figure could be clea

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "'Come out of it!" he snapped, pointing the

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 revolver directly at the dim figure of Frank, "Come out of it, or I'll shoot!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Further resistance was useless.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With sinking heart Frank advanced toward' the edge of the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 opening in the floor, while Joe and Fenton Hardy followed, with arms upraised. The smuggler backed his way down the steps, still keeping them covered, until he reached the bottom of the stairs.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys descended, conscious of an array of leveled revolv\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ers that covered every movement. They saw Snackley standing in the forefront of the crowd. They were captured again.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The three were surrounded by the smugglers. The light sho\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ne on their evil, bearded faces and glittered on the drawn revolvers. Fenton Hardy's useless weapon had been snatched from him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Downstairs!" snapped Snackley. "Get downstairs with you."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He prodded Frank with the barrel of his revolver as he spoke. The Har\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
dy boys moved toward the stairs, their father in the rear. One of the smugglers went ahead in case the prisoners should by chance make some desperate break for freedom.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When they reached the lower room they paused while the man ahead lit a match. The elect\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ric light had been broken. Hardly had the match flared than there came the sound of thudding feet through the kitchen and the back door banged noisily.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Some one rushed into the room, gasping for breath. The light revealed him to be another of the smugglers.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ' 'Police!" he exclaimed, in terror. '' They 're coming down the lane!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A babel of voices followed. The smugglers came tumbling down the stairs in their haste. With one bound Snackley leaped forward and seized the man by the collar.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Down the lane!" gasped the man. "They came down the road in a car and they're closing in on the house. I saw them."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a yell, Snackley flung the man to one side.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Down into the cave!" h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e roared. "Quick!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Confusion prevailed. In the resulting uproar the match went out and the room was plunged into darkness.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank resolved on a daring move. He was standing directly beside one of the smugglers, and as soon as the light went out he sprang a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
t the fellow, dashing the revolver from his grasp. It clattered on the floor.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Help!" roared the fellow, as they grappled together.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy had also been watching for his chance, and he sprang through the darkness at Snackley. He collided heavily with\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 the chief of the smugglers and they rolled on the floor in a desperate struggle.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was impossible to distinguish friend from enemy in the darkness. Joe plunged into the midst of the surging figures and his fist smashed against the face of one of the smug\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
glers, who gave a howl of pain.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then, outside the house, another uproar burst forth.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Some one was banging on the front door. Men could be heard shouting to one another.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Snackley made a desperate effort \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
and managed to get to his feet. He struck out with both fists and managed to break free from the detective. He whirled to one side, stumbled out into the kitchen, and then reached the back door. He flung the door open.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Almost instantly a dark figure appear\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The police!" he roared. "Every man for himself I Make your getaway!''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The trooper shot\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 through the doorway at him, but Snackley dodged to one side. There was a rush of footsteps from the other room as the rest of the smugglers raced out into the kitchen. The officers tried to hold them back, but they were too many for him and he was hurled
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 against the wall.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Utter confusion prevailed. The place was in absolute darkness and out in the yard shots, shouts and hoarse imprecations mingled in an indescribable uproar.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 One of the smugglers managed to reach the shed. He flung open the trapdoor and des\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 cended the steps. Some of his companions

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Half a dozen police officers were in the yard. They had been attracted to the house by the sound of the sh\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Back in the living room of the house Frank was still struggl\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ing with his antagonist. The man was strong and heavy, a rough-and-tumble fighter, and the boy soon found that he had his lands full. They struggled desperately in the darkness, the smuggler frantic with the fear of capture, Frank grimly resolved that the

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy headed toward the door lead-i ing into the kitchen. Just then a figure brushed by him. He made a grab for the man, but the fellow evaded him and raced toward the other side of the room.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective gave chase. The fu\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 gitive kicked open a door and ran toward the front of the house. Mr. Hardy could follow }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\ul\insrsid14443635

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The fugitive scurried into a front room and banged the door behind him. Mr. Hardy launched himself against the door, w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hich had a lock that snapped when the door shut. For

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His fugitive had disappeared.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But the room was faintly lighted, as there was a wide window, and in the gloom the detective could see a dark patch in the floor. It was a trapdoor leading evidently to the cell\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ar.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He went down through the opening, finding a flight of stairs which he descended. He could hear footsteps receding through the darkness but he made his way across the uneven floor of the cellar.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective stopped and listened. He heard the hurrying \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
footsteps as the smuggler went on to the far end of the cellar. Then, to his great surprise, he heard a voice. In the distance he saw a faint glow of light. Then he saw that the cellar was divided into two parts and that the fugitive had entered a small r

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes-the police-state troopers, federal officers and all. But don't think you're going to have a chance of squealing on us. I'm going to fix you, as I should have done a long while ago."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The other voice rose, replete with terror.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No! No! You won't do that, Snackley! Let me live!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fenton Hardy crept swiftly over to the door. He saw Snackley standing by a small cot in a cell-like room. On the cot crouched a haggard man whose hands were handcuffed he-hind him. His feet were shackled 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 to one leg of the iron cot.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Snackley, with a grim look of cruelty on his face, was raising a heavy cluh he had picked up.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was no time to lose. The detective sprang through the doorway.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He plunged at Snackley just as the smuggler raised the cluh to st\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rike.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Snackley reeled against the wall, with Fenton Hardy at his throat. Desperately, the smuggler tried to raise the weapon, but the detective had seized his wrist. They swayed to and fro, stumbling about on the muddy floor. Mr. Hardy had the advantage in
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  that he had taken Snackley by surprise. He pinned the smuggler against the wall, twisting his wrist. The club fell to the floor.

on Hardy wrenched his arm free, sprawled over and managed to seize Snackley's revolver. He pressed it against Snackley's 'side.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Upstairs!" snapped the detective curtly. Without taking his eyes off Snackley he said to the man on the cot.

 chamber where his father had been a prisoner, but on entering the room he found it empty. There were evidences of hasty flight and the door on the far side of the room was wide open.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe led the way out through the opposite door and down the stairs that led toward the bottom of the cliff. The trooper who had spoken illuminated the way with his flashlight and they clattered on down the stairs u

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 There was a shout from the darkness of the cove.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Give us a light!" they heard.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe gave a shout of joy. It was Tony Prito's voice!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then Joe and the troopers \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 with him heard the steady beat of a motorboat.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe seized the flashlight and ran out along the path leading to the entrance of the cave.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The motorboat was not many yards away. Tony had been searching for the channel.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the motorboat drew nearer he saw that it was filled with men and that a rowboat was being towed behind.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We got 'em," cried Tony exultantly. "They were just getting out \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 of the cove in the boat when we came up."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Who is with you?" asked Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Police. The rest of them went up the shore road in a car."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No chance. Although it was mighty close. They pretty nearly slipped out of the cove right under our noses."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boat came to a stop beside the natural wharf of rock. One or two of the officers, revolvers in \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
hand, clambered out. Three of the smugglers had been captured while trying to escape from the cove in the rowboat.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If they'd got out we would never have caught them," said Joe. "They were heading out toward a ship."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A ship!" exclaimed one of the officers\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , a burly man in plain clothes. He stepped forward. "Did they say anything about a ship?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A man named Li Chang has a ship lying in wait outside the bay," said Joe. "I heard them talking about it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good!" exclaimed the burly man. "Now we'll capture the wh\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ole outfit." He turned to Tony. "I suppose your boat is good for another little run."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll say it is, sir!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 " Good!   Don't lose any time.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The three smugglers were taken out of the boat and handcuffed, then escorted up the stairs,\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 while the burly man, who was the chief of a squad of federal agents undertaking a drive against the smugglers on that part of the coast, remained with the motorboat.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Within a short time Darst returned with three more officers. He reported that a clean swe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ep had been made at the house.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They have 'em all handcuffed and sittin* in the kitchen," he said. "Mr. Hardy got Snackley-"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The officers got into the motorboat and Joe clambered in beside Tony Prito, who was at' the wheel. The craft backed out of the channel into the deeper water of the cove, then sped out into Barmet Bay.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Once we get out of the bay we should s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ee' her lights," said the federal officer. "Li Chang probably has his ship anchored just off the coast."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 This proved to be the case. The lights of the vessel were soon descried and the motor-boat sped toward it through the night.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When the boat drew alongsi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 de, the federal man roared out:
