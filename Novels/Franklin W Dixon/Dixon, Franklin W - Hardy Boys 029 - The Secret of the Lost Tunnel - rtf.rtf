\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The telephone in the Hardy home gave a long, urgent ring, as the clock struck four. Blon\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d-haired Joe bounded into the hall and lifted the receiver.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Fenton Hardy's residence," he said, and in answer to a query, "My father is not at home. Will you leave a message?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This is Dr. Bush," the man informed him in a deep voice. "You're going to have\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 a caller. Watch your step and pay no attention to his story. He's dangerous. He's out of his mind." Dr. Bush talked a few seconds longer, then hung up abruptly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe returned to the living room, a puzzled look on his face.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's the matter?" asked his br\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 other Frank, who was dark-haired and a year older.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 2 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A General Smith is coming here. Dr. Bush, who just phoned, says the general's crazy. Thinks his family buried some Civil War treasure and is going to ask us to help find it\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Before Joe had a chance to explain further, the telephone rang again. He answered it.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hello?" Placing his hand over the mouthpiece, he whispered to Frank, "A woman. She knows Dr. Bush." Then into the instrument he said, "Yes. Yes. Why? Hello, hello!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 T\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he click on the other end of the line was evidence the woman had ended the conversation.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Who was she?" Frank asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Didn't give her name," Joe replied. "But listen to this. She said if we heard from a Dr. Bush we should call the police immediately."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Jum\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ping cows!" Frank exclaimed. "A mystery to solve before we even see the people in it. I wonder ..."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His words were interrupted by the ringing of the front doorbell. Joe opened the door. Before him stood a man in the uniform of the United States Army. On hi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
s shoulder he wore the single star of a brigadier general.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm General Smith," he said. "I'd like to see Mr. Hardy."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Step in, please," Joe said politely. He shot a
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Double Warning 3
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 quick glance at Frank, then surveyed the stranger carefully.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The general,\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  whether mentally unbalanced or not, had all the bearing of a military man. He was of medium build and stocky, with a ruddy complexion, blue eyes, and red hair.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "My father's not here," Frank told him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's too bad. How is your father?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why'm-uh, very w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ell," Frank replied.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wonderful man," General Smith commented.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You'm-uh, know him?" Joe asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Surely. I came to speak to him on a very important matter."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We could give him your message," Frank offered. "I'm Frank, and this is my brother Joe. Dad's been away. We expect him back some time today."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank remembered what his father once had told him about dealing with a mentally unbalanced person. If treated po\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
litely and gently, the person might react normally. Only if shocked or upset would he reveal any mental aberration.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 General Smith walked into the living room and seated himself in Fenton Hardy's favorite club chair, looking keenly at the brothers.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll re\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 late my story briefly," the man said. "You can tell your father, in case he doesn't get back before I return to Washington. It concerns a treas-
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 4 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ure buried during the Civil War. I want him to find it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The words electrified \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
the Hardys. This was it. No doubt about it. Just the patter Dr. Bush had warned them about. But on second thought, they had been warned about Dr. Bush too. "A double mystery," Joe thought.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He stole a glance at Frank. His brother looked puzzled as the man c\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ontinued.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "My grandfather, a Confederate general," he said, "was disgraced during the Civil War because he lost -A bandoleer containing a silver ammunition box."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Bandoleer?" Joe asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes. A military shoulder strap. Today they contain cartridges. The ol\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d one my grandfather lost merely carried a small box."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What was disgraceful about losing that?" Frank asked as he observed the man intently.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The box contained no bullets," the general explained. "But it did contain a secret which has remained unsolved to\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 this day. Here's the way it happened. Just before a certain battle, my grand-lather called at the plantation of his cousin, Beaure-gard Smith, a wealthy planter and president of the local bank. Beauregard confided to my grandfather that if enemy troops g
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 o\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t too close, he would bury his gold, together with that belonging to the bank."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Double Warning 5
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What happened then?" Joe put in eagerly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man moved uneasily in his chair. "Just before the Battle of Rocky Run," he went on, "an old slave from Beauregard\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 Smith's plantation ran into Grandfather's headquarters. He handed him a sealed envelope, saying, 'It's de secret Massa told yo' 'bout!' Then he dropped dead from exhaustion."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the visitor stopped speaking, he sprang from his chair and paced rapidly towa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rd the door.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's he going to do now?" Frank wondered, recalling the telephone warning.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But as if the general read the boy's mind, he turned sharply on his heel and paced back, continuing his story.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Grandfather had only time enough to glance at the mes\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 sage. It contained a series of numbers. Sounds crazy, I know."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe gulped and looked at his feet. He agreed; it did sound like a crazy man's story.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Across the face of the message," the general pro ceeded, "were the letters C S A. Meanwhile, scoutji brough\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
t in reports of the enemy's approach, and Grandfather had to issue a call to arms. The opposing sides joined in battle shortly afterward, and ihe fight continued into the night. In the darkness and confusion, the bandoleer and the ammunition box disappear
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d, and with them the secret."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 6 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Didn't Beauregard Smith remember?" Frank asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The general stared directly through Frank as if gazing at an apparition.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He was killed defending his plantation. His place was cannonaded and burned to the ground." The brigadier started to pace again.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Beauregard Smith's family was penniless, and in disgrace, :oo, because the bank's gold was lost. Furthermore, they even accus\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed my grandfather of taking it for his own use!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe let out a whistle. "Some accusation!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank nodded in agreement.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No sense to it, of course," the officer stormed. "But Beaurcgard's relatives felt my grandfather might not be telling the truth about the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 secret message disappearing. There was gossip he had found ihe family treasure."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The telephone rang again, startling the general and the boys. Frank leaped to answer it. The }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid15664820 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 c}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Has Smith arrived?" he asked abruptly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hold on a moment," \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the silence that followed, Frank strained to hear any familiar sound that might identify the place from which the doctor was calling. In a second he was rewarded. The Avords, "Two on a raftl"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank beckoned to Joe and whispered, "Bush is at Shorty's Diner. I'll try to keep him talking while you nab him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Excusing himself to the general, Joe raced from the house.

 carried him speedily toward Shorty's Diner, located a quarter of a mile away in die downtown Bayport section. Reaching it, he bounded up the front steps and pushed back the sliding door.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the tempting aroma of sizzling hamburgers and coffee drifted to J\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
oe's nostrils, he glanced quickly toward the telephone booth at the end of the long counter. The door was open. Nobody was inside!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly a rotund youth sitting on a stool swung around. In his hand he held half of a Western sandwich.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hello, Joe," he sai\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d. "What's the big hurry?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Chet!" Joe exclaimed. "Did you see anybody come out of the phone booth?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't rush me," Chet pleaded, and bit into the sandwich.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet Morton, pal of the Hardys, enjoyed eating and did not like to be hur\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ried. Nevertheless, he gulped, what remained of his third sandwich and blurted to Joe:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 " 'Course I saw the guy. He went out that side door. What's up?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe raced through the door, then halted on the sidewalk. Chet lumbered after him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think that's the ma\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n down the street there," Chet volunteered. "He was tall and wore a dark suit. Carried a black bag."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Without a word, Joe sped after the figure who was now a block away. As he ran, Dr. Bush glanced back, then broke into a trot. At that moment a red-and-white taxi turned the corner. The man hailed it. As the cab came to a halt, he hopped in and rode off be
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 f\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ore Joe could catch up with him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe turned dejectedly as Chet arrived on the scene "Didn't even get a good look at him," Joe moaned.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Is he a crook?" Chet asked, puffing.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe. Anyway, somebody asked us to get the police after him. I wish I hadn't lost \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't worry, pal," Chet piped up. "I figured this was another detective case, so I decided to help you."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 10 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 For the first time, Joe noticed that his plump friend held a strange-looking contraption in his hands.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I took \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 his picture," Chet said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boy grinned as he held an old battered camera toward Joe. On the front mount was a telescopic lens.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I got a telephoto snapshot," Chet said proudly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Are you sure?" Joe eyed the camera skeptically. "Where'd you get this?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "At a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  pawnshop," Chet explained. "Just because I got it secondhand doesn't mean it's no good."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe examined the camera. The lens was good enough, but the bellows seemed brittle and had been patched here and there.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I hope it hasn't any light leaks," Joe said, h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 anding the box back to Chet. "I'd sure like to have a picture of that man!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Count on me," Chet said as the two boys hurried toward the Hardy home to develop the picture. "You fellows working on a dangerous mystery?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet's voice contained a note of appreh\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ension. The Hardy boys, his closest friends, were sons of Bayport's famous detective, Fenton Hardy, and had solved many cases, beginning with "The Tower Treasure." Although Chet liked their companionship, he always was fearful of the risks they ran.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
The memory of their last adventure, which had come to be known as "The Sign of the Crooked Arrow," was still fresh in his mind. Chet often shuddered anew when he recalled the hostile band of outlaws they had encountered in the Western moun
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 tains.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I said, are you working on a new case?" Chet asked again.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't know yet," Joe replied, and explained hurriedly about the mysterious telephone calls.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't like it," Chet commented as the two entered the Hardy home.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank met them at the door\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 . "Did you find Dr. Bush?" he whispered excitedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe shook his head, then Frank explained in low tones that the doctor had ended their telephone conversation very abruptly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe he saw Joe running toward the diner," Chet suggested.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 After hastily introd\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ucing Chet to General Smith, Joe ushered him into the basement, where the Hardy boys had their darkroom.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You h find developer and hypo under the bench, Chet. I hope the picture's good."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 While Chet was busy removing the film from the old camera, Joe rejoin\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed his brother and General Smith.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I must say," the general commented, "that you boys sure dash around."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank apologized for the interruption and explained, "Our friend Chet's a photographer and uses our equipment sometimes. Please go on with your story about the Civil War, General Smith."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "When my grandfather failed to clear up the mystery, my father took a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  hand, because the Beauregard Smith branch of the family still blame us for the loss of their fortune in gold."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe sat tensely on the edge of their chairs, listening.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "My father was a general, too," their caller said. "The military tradition has\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  been the pride of our family for over a century. That's why I'm determined to find the treasure!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 General Smith thumped the table beside him so hard the lamp on it teetered precariously. He jumped from his chair and began to pace the room. The brothers lo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
oked at each other in alarm. Were they going to have trouble with the man? Seating himself, the general continued:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Father questioned old Civil War soldiers about what went on during the battle in which the ammunition box with the secret message had vanish\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "So your grandfather's army won?" Joe queried eagerly, completely forgetting that General Smith might be a bit deranged and the whole story false.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe's thoughts ran along a different vein. "You want Dad to help you find the hidden gold?" he asked. "The only clue is Bingham, and you don't know what happened to him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 General Smith frowned. "I know it'll be har\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d, but I have a lot of faith in your father's reputation."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Dad's the best detective in this part of the country," Joe said. "You came to the right man. But there's just one hitch. Dad'll want proof of your story before . . ."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The look which flashed across\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the general's face was ample evidence Joe had said the wrong thing.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Thanks. And now, Jack, we have another mystery to solve. Tell General Smith what you just told me, Joe."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Upon hearing the insanity story, General\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Smith threw back his head and laughed heartily.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It only goes to show you can't tell who's crazy. I've thought ever since I came here, Fenton, that your sons were acting pretty daffy!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Grinning like a couple of boys, Mr. Hardy and General Smith recalled t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not the faintest," General Smith answered, a ivorried frown creasing his forehead.

The officer told how he had made a quick trip down to Centerville, the nearest town to the old Beauregard Smith plantation. While there, he had discovered that someone was digging secretly on the property. At once he had decided 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 to enlist Fenton Hardy's help and had written the letter.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Somebody intercepted the mail," Mr. Hardy surmised, "and learned you were coming here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective asked the officer for a resume of the

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 strange story of the missing ban\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 doleer. While he was telling it, Frank and Joe went to the cellar to see Chet. They found him in the darkroom, ga/ing at a wet print of Dr. Bush.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hey, this is only half a picture!" Joe exclaimed, peering at it. "Nothing but the doctor's legs and a black b\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ag."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet was crestfallen. His telephoto camera had failed him. "Guess I'll just tear this up and start all over again," he said glumly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't do that!" Frank interrupted. "This might be a valuable clue. Dad says never discard a single bit of evidence."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 W\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hen the three boys returned to the living room, Mr. Hardy was saying:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We ought to find out if anybody in town can give us a good description of the man. That means quizzing cab drivers until we find the one who drove him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll do it," Frank offered. "W\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ant to come, Chet?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet said he had to go home. The boys walked with him to a bus stop, then hurried toward the Bayport railroad station. Ordinarily, the brothers would have used their own car, but it was in a garage for a checkup.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 alongside the tracks, Frank spoke to one of the drivers.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Did you pick up a fare near Shorty's Diner about an hour ago?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No. Haven't been out that way all day."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The other driven, also gave negative \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 answers. Seeing the boys' glum look, the taxi dispatcher said:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Probably the cab you're looking for came from out of town."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe thanked the man for his suggestion, but without a license number it would be almost impossible to trace the cab. When the boys r\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
eached home, Mr Hardy and General Smith were still discussing the mystery. Their Aunt Gertrude, Mr. Hardy's spinster sister, who lived with them, had come in, and heard the story.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No good will come of this," the brothers heard her prophesy as they entered the living room. "The minute I heard a woman was involved-"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Now, Gertrude," Mr. Hardy spoke up, used to her quick decisions, "she probably represents law and order."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't bel\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ieve it," said his sister, who was apt to be peppery in her opinions. "And as for that doctor -oh, my pie's burning!" She rushed from the room,
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What I'm afraid of," General Smith said, "is that the secret message in the old bandoleer has been
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The General'\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s Enemies 21
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t'ound and the crook is trying to locate the gold."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Mr. Hardy set his friend's mind at rest on this score. "It's possible the message has been found, but if the gold cache had been located, Dr. Bush wouldn't be on your trail."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If he's a crook\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , he probably has a criminal record," Frank suggested.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's logical thinking," his father said. "We'll go up to my study and take a look at the pictures in my rogues' gallery. Jack, you may recognize somebody who was at the hotel in Centerville. Then we
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 'll know who is on your trail."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The four trooped to the second floor, and turned on the lights. The detective spread dozens of rogues' gallery pictures out over his desk. The general scanned each one carefully but concluded he had never seen any of the sha

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I couldn't find anything wrong, though."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "p>?t the same, let's get out of here," Frank suggested. "I'll take the wheel."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the beautifully \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 verdant countryside rolled past, he looked into the rear-view mirror.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "See that car back there?" he asked Joe, who was beside him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His brother turned in the seat and peered behind. A black sedan was following them a hundred feet back.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll bet he's traili\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ng us!" Joe said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank slowed down. When the other car did likewise, Frank speeded up. The trailing sedan kept pace.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when the Hardys' car coughed and sputtered. As Frank gui\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ded the coupe around a sharp curve, the accelerator suddenly failed to respond. Frank steered to the side of the road, losing speed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As he did, the sedan suddenly shot forward alongside the Hardy car. In a split second it cut sharply

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Look! Here comes a truck!" Frank cried out. "Let's get the driver to pull us out of here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He stepped on\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 to the highway and flagged a big van, which came to a halt in front of him.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Guess you'll be okay now," he said.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll stop on the outskirts of Centerville," General Smith \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 said. "I have a home there. We'll make it our headquarters."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 red brick, was flanked by two rows of oak trees. Behind them \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 quaint old houses stood in the shade of blossoming magnolias.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Farther on, the street gave way to a square, on the edge of which sprawled a handful of stores, a small but stately courthouse, and a tall-pillared hotel. A. solitary, bewhiskered man sat on the

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A peaceful old town," the general replied, smiling. "My place is a quarter mile down the road."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank drove on, and presently the general pointed out a driveway, which cut through a thick hedge of boxwood.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here's headquarters," he said as Frank stopped before a yellow, clapboard house with tall, shuttered windows and doors, nestled far back from the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  road.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What a swell place!" Chet exclaimed. "I'm going to sit under this big tree and eat and sleep-"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You fellows will bunk here," he said.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Follow me." The general led the way downstairs and into the kitchen. He opened the door of a shiny white refrigerator, whose shelves were laden with food.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wow!" Chet exclaimed. "How did this ha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ppen?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Centerville's butcher has a duplicate key to this house," the general explained. "I sent Mr. Oakes a wire instructing him 10 provision up for four hungry men.'

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys set to work preparing the evening meal. When t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hey finished eating, General Smith suggested they set off for town.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Evening was casting long shadows on the square when they arrived in Centerville. General SrniJi pointed out several large houses whose history dated from the Revolution, then stopped to ta\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Tolerable good," said one of the men, a gaunt-faced fellow who answered to the name of Jeb. "But there's too many furriners ar\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oamin' these parts."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank, Joe, and Chet colored up. Did he mean them? The general shot an uneasy glance at Jeb, then bade the men good night.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What do you think Jeb meant by foreigners?" Joe asked when they were out of earshot of the men.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "One of two thi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ngs," the officer replied. "He could have meant you boys, of course, but he probably meant some other strangers that have come to Centerville}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good idea," the general agreed. "Tomorrow we'll go to the farmhouse where my grandfather had his headquarters. The main part is still intact; lies just off the battlefield."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Anybody living there?" Joe asked.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet grinned. "Take a picture."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His friends laughed. Joe, yawning, said he was going to hit that four-poster so he could be good and fresh in the morning. The rest followed him upstairs.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Prank drove up to the old building and let the motor idle. What remained of the one-story farmhouse was in fair \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the general joined in the search, Frank said, "It probably flew out of your h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ands when you dropped down into the wellhole. How about holding a light rock and going through the motions of your fall, Chet?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What? Not me!" the boy protested, eying the well.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, you don't have to fall into the hole again," Frank said, grinning.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 picked up a small stone. Keeping a wary eye on the hole, he went through the motions of his spill.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank watched the stone sail over Chet's head. When it landed, he was on the spot immediately. He patted the long grass with his hands.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here it is!" he shouted, lifting the camera up. "And not a scratch on it! Luckily it fell into that patch of soft grass."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet took the camera into his hands, caressing it as he would a kitten.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What about the man you saw?" Joe persisted. "Are you }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid4016876 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 sure }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid4016876

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What did he look like?" Frank asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 On the Spy Trail 53

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the group started out of the woods, Frank noticed diet was limping a little and asked if he wanted to go home.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll be okay," the boy answered. "Well, I got in trouble trying to figure out where that spy Bing-ham went. What do you fellows think?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Fr\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ank and Joe shrugged. "I'd like to hear the story of the battle first," Frank said. "General Smith, will you explain just where the troops were stationed?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The officer turned to a hill beyond the one from which they had come, and with a sweep of his arm, s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
aid, "That ridge was held by the Northern troops. They had three lines of riflemen, backed by a strong force of artillery."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They pushed down the hill and captured your grandfather's headquarters?" Joe surmised.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not exactly. It was in sort of a no man's l\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
and. The Southern troops were in this valley when the ittack began. They retreated to that ridge over there." He pointed to another hill a mile distant which was higher and steeper than the one the Federals had held.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If Bi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ngham got into your grandfather's headquarters," Joe continued, "all he'd have to do would be to hide until the battle was over."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It wasn't as easy as that," the general said, smiling at Joe. "Grandfather had a force of cavalry in reserve. They counteratt\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 acked on the left flank and cut a wedge into the opposing forces."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then Bingham was checked from going straight back to his own lines," Frank said eagerly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It seems to me he wouldn't have had a chance to get through that line of cavalry," the officer sai\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
d. "It was led by Colonel Stone, the Old Mud Fox, and did sufficient damage to turn the tide of the fight."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then Bingham would have had to go around Stone's men and along the Rocky Run," Frank reasoned, "until he could contact his own forces again."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e tried that," the general said, "he probably ran into more trouble, because artillery, which was rushed to my grandfather's aid, opened up from the opposite ridge. Their cannon fire blasted Bing-ham's possible escape route. From all accounts, it was a te

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He might not have come out of it alive," Joe said, "but if he did, I think he'd have gone in the direction Frank indicated."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "True enough," the officer said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 On the Spy Trail 55,
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then let's follow that trail!" Joe exclaimed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"Remember one thing," General Smith said. "A good soldier makes the most of natural cover. Bing-ham would have made his way behind trees, boulders, along depressions in the ground, and behind slight rises to afford protection from the artillery. Well, let
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 '\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s start!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Gosh," Chet said, "I never thought of that. I think I'd go in a beeline just as fast as I could!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What a target you'd be!" Joe remarked as they started on the once harrowing trail which Bingham might have taken.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank led the way, and the gener\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 al nodded approvingly as the boy picked a route which provided the least exposure to cannon which years before had thundered from the ridge across the valley.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're a natural soldier, Frank," the officer said, smiling.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The trek was hot and arduous. Final\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ly they came to the bank of Rocky Run.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think Bingham would have followed the stream here," Frank surmised.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Right," the general agreed. "He'd put the water between him and those daredevil horsemen of Old Mud Fox."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why did they call him Mud Fox?" Chet a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 sked. "Did he look like a fox?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 56 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not at all. He was a very mild-looking gentle man about five feet tall, but as wiry and foxy as any cavalryman who ever lived. One night he led his men across a mud flat that nobody else dar\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ed enter, and attacked a much larger enemy force. He cut down half of them and captured the others. That's when he got his nickname."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe whistled. "We could use a fox in this case right now."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hey!" Chet shouted suddenly. "There's a bridge Bingham could h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ave hidden under 1"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's investigate it," Joe suggested as they came in sight of a span which carried the main highway over the Rocky Run. "Only that's a concrete bridge. It must have been built long after the Civil War."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "So it was," the officer concurr\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed. "But there was an old bridge around here somewhere. My grandfather ordered it destroyed to stop the main drive of the enemy."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 By this time the four were within a stone's throw of the span. Suddenly a black sedan whizzed over it, the driver glancing dow\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank, Joe, and the general set off down the road toward the plantation. When they came to the fork, they took the left one and were halfway to the old Civil War farm of the Smith family when a horn blew behind them.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Investigate the old museum. We might find a battlefield relic that would provide a clue. Maybe Bingham hid the bandoleer some place in the old building, and it hasn't been found yet."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet, who was sleepy from having overeaten, would have liked to take a nap, but the boys urged him to accompany them. Half an hour later\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys turned their attention to the wall, where half a dozen rare old pictures showed a local encampment just before the battl\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e of Rocky Run.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't forget we're looking for a clue to the old bandoleer," Frank remarked.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He was a tall, scrawny man with a long, sharp nose, which was accentuated by a broad black mustache and flowing black hair. Dressed in the clothes of a plantation owner of the Civil War period, the man looked as if he might

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm Professor Randolph," he said with a deep voice, "and who are these unbidden guests trespassing on my property?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The professor was quick to percei\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ve the boy's decision. The smile that came to his face was triumphant rather than friendly.

rank drove home. Hardly had the boys entered the house, when they realized the Army officer was battling with a problem of his own. The brigadier was decidedly agitated. He was pacing up and down the living room, his red hair rumpled. So wrapped in though

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank was alarmed. What dire turn of events had happened?
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "General Smith, what's the matter?" he asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Aroused from his thoughts, the man turned with a start.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Matter? Everything! The house has bee\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n ransacked!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Jumping cows!" Joe exclaimed. "Since we ate lunch?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It must have happened before then," the officer replied. "Nothing downstairs was touched. Just the second-floor bedrooms!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "None of us went up there at noontime," Frank recalled.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If you'd only let me go up-" Chet began.

\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  snorted impatiently. "The fact is, that an intruder was looking for something in this house!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You mean nothing\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  was taken?" Frank asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Nothing so far as I can make out," the officer replied. "The contents of our suitcases and dresser drawers were strewn about. You'd better check on your own belongings."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe ran up the stairs three at a time. They found\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 their room a picture of disarray. Clothes which they had hung up in the closet lay on the floor and the contents of their bags were scattered over the rug.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Gosh," Chet moaned as he began to pick up hi? stuff, "I hope they didn't take it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Take what?" Jo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e was curious.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I had a box of special attachments for my camera in this . . . oh, here it is!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys went about examining their things }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid14502800 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 minutely}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid4016876

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "All my stuff is here," Joe said finally.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Mine too," Frank added, rising f\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rom his kneeling position. Then he let out a sudden exclamation 'Wait! The picture is gone!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 70 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Picture?" the general repeated.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The half-man that Chet snapped in Bayport."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That proves it!" Joe shouted. "Dr. Bush has been he\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 re! Nobody else but Bush would want that photo."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Right," Frank agreed. "But I don't think that's what he was after."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What else?" Chet piped up. "That was a valu\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 able picture. I even brought another one in my wallet."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's good," Joe said. "But I beli\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 eve Bush was after a map showing where the lost gold was buried."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But we haven't any map," Chet said, perplexed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Bush probably thinks we have," Joe came back. "Which proves he still doesn't know where to look for the treasure and thinks we've got a clue!\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 By the time the boys had straightened up the place, General Smith had regained his composure.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We must get a servant to guard this house when \bullet we're away," he said. "I know just the man for the job, if he's still in town."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The officer went to the telepho\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ne and in a moment was talking to someone named Sara. As the boys exchanged puzzled glances, Smith said to the woman:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll send Claude a note. Give it to him when he returns."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Rifled Luggage 71!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
After completing the call, General Smith explained to his visitors that Claude was his Army orderly and was on vacation at his home in Centerville, too. The brigadier requested the boys to deliver the note, as he did not want to leave the house unoccupied
.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  He suggested they continue their sleuthing alone.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Before going, Frank asked the officer if he knew Professor Randolph, and told him about the incident at the museum.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No, never heard of him," Smith replied. "But it doesn't surprise me to learn the museum'\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s been sold. It always ran at a loss."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Upon reaching Centerville, Frank parked in the town square. Joe offered to deliver the general's note and started down the narrow, cobblestone street where the orderly lived. As the others waited for him, Frank gazed 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 across the square. His eyes lighted on the courthouse and an idea occurred to him. If Professor Randolph had bought the museum, the deed would be registered there.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wait here a minute," he said to Chet. "I'll be right back."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The courthouse was a low brick \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
building that looked like a church without a steeple. Two heavy white columns stood on either side of the front doorway. Frank entered and asked an attendant where
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 72 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 deeds were registered. He was directed to an office at the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 side of the building. In it sat an old man, on whose desk towered row upon row of thick volumes of records.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Something I can do for you?" he asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes," Frank replied. "I've been told the old Rocky Run Museum has been sold to a Professor Randolph."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hm,"\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  said the man, peering over his spectacles. "That's news to me. Nothing of the sort has been registered here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe the deed was recorded while you were out," Frank suggested.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man hooked his thumbs into his suspenders and tilted back in his chair.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "S\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 on," he said, "I've been settin' here for forty years, 'cept for lunch, and when I'm out, this office is closed."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank smiled, thanked the man, and walked back to the car. "I had a hunch Professor Randolph's story was a fake," he told Chet and his brother\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , who had returned from the orderly's house.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Upon hearing Frank's report, Chet made a decision. "I guess we'll let Randolph and his fake stories alone. I think that old museum is a good place to stay away from."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I should say not!" Frank's jaw jutted with \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 de-

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And continue our tour," Joe put in. "I wonder why he didn't want us in there."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe he likes to do his studying alone," Chet ventured.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's probably m\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ore to it than that," Frank said. "Maybe he knows some secret about the museum."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And we're going to find out if it has anything to do with our case," Joe added as he stepped into the car.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Say, fellows," Frank whispered, "I think somebody's watching us." \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He glanced out the corner of his eye in the direction of the hotel.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Who?" Chet asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I didn't see enough to identify him, but I saw a man slip into the alley alongside the building."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe glanced across the square. Nobody was in evidence except a short, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 thin man with a stubbly gray beard. He wore mud-spattered overalls and was leaning against one of the hotel pillars.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't like this," Frank said uneasily.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Do you suppose that was Dr. Bush spying on us?" Chet wondered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If it was," Frank replied, "we ought to throw him off our trail."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 74 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "By finding a back route to the museum. Maybe there's a side road which only the natives know about."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That fellow over there looks like one," Joe sa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 id, nodding in the direction of the man in front of the hotel.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll ask him," Frank offered, stepping out of the car and going over to the man. "I'd like to go to the Rocky Run Museum," he said, "but not by the main road. Is there any other?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man look\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed at Frank suspiciously. "Yeah, there's another way," he said slowly. "Why you want to know?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "To see the country," the boy answered noncom-mittally.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The old fellow outlined the directions on the side of the white pillar with a dirty finger.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank listene\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d intently. "I get you," he said. "Thanks."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank returned to the car and told the others of the roundabout way to the museum.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If anybody's following us, he'll be thrown off the track," he said. "Let's go!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A dirt road led the boys off the main highway an\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d through a stretch of woodland. The trees interlaced high overhead, making a canopy which shielded out the afternoon sun.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Rifled Luggage 75
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We're not going to get there in a hurry," Joe said. "This road's too bumpy."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank deftly steered the car along th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e rutty road, avoiding large rocks which now and then jutted from the side. They drove down a little gully, then up a steep slope.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hey, wait!" Chet shouted suddenly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's up?" Joe did not want to stop.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 undred yards to the left near a brook in the woods stood three deer.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Come on, stop!" Chet pleaded, as Frank made no move to put on the brake.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Okay. Make it snappy."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank brought the car to a halt and Chet climbed out. He flipped down the front of his ca\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Take 'em from here," Joe said softly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No, I have to get closer."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet walked a dozen paces, pe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ered into his view finder, and advanced a few more feet.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the stillness Frank thought he heard the sound of a motor behind them. He looked back. No car was in sight, and the hum stopped.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Guess I'm jittery," he told himself.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hurry up!" Joe called to Che\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But Chet had other ideas. Still thinking he could

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But before Chet could click the shutter, a startled shout broke the stillness of the woodland like crashing glass. In a flash the deer leaped away.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet whirled about to see who had spoiled\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  his picture. No one was in sight. In sudden panic Chet raced back to the road.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He got in touch with the local police chief, told him about the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid10426339 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 kidnapping}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f1\fs24\insrsid4016876 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , and asked if there were any known criminal using the alias Baby \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Face. The chief searched his files and reported that to his knowledge there was not. He added that he would send out an eight-state alarm for the kidnapers.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Next, Frank called long-distance, placing a message to Bayport. A few seconds later Aunt Gertrude a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nswered. When Frank asked for his father, hi*

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 aunt said he had not returned yet from Washington. Then she added apprehensively:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Something serious must be happening, Frank, or you wouldn't be calling home."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're right," \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank admitted with a smile. "We've run into a character named Baby Face. I thought Dad could check his files for a criminal by that name."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The gasp that sounded all the way from Bayport was so intense that Frank could almost feel Aunt Gertrude's breath on\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  his cheek.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Baby Face!" The detective's sister grasped the import at once. "One of the men who tried to break into our house! He's chasing you down South?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He was, Auntie. Now we're chasing him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't get me all mixed up," came the reply. "He's a wolf \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 in sheep's clothing. Look out for him! I'll tell your father about Baby Face. You're running up a big telephone bill. Good-bye."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank hung up when he heard a click on the other end of the line. "I think Aunt Gertrude's right about a wolf in sheep's clothi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ng," he remarked, relaying the story. "She has an uncanny way with her predictions."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Breakfast is served!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With those welcome words, the boys and the general sat down to an old-fashioned southern repast.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 An Important Canteen 91
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet's face was aglow as Cl\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
aude served chilled cantaloupe, followed by crisp-fringed pancakes and broiled ham. Then he brought in a platter of fried eggs, a dish of raspberry jam, and piping hot mullins.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Letting his belt out two notches, Chet asked, "General, does everybody eat like\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  this in the South?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They used to," the officer replied, smiling wanly. "Most people are in too much of a hurry today to enjoy the art of good eating."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Not me!" Chet decorated another muffin with a daub of jam. "The South's a wonderful place, General."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's go back to the museum," Joe said when they finished eating.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I hope Professor Randolph is around," Frank remarked. "I'd like to tell him he doesn't own that property."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We've already paid our admission," Chet put in. "We ought to get in free today!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The general remarked that he was sorry that he could not accompany the boys. He had an appointment with a real-estate agent in a neighboring town to discuss the sale of some property.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A short time later the boys arrived at the museum. When they walked thr\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ough the front door, a new guard greeted them. In the old Negro's place sat a stout man, whose red face was particularly striking
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 92 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 because of a scar that ran from the side of his mouth like an extra-wide smile.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He apparently\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  was wearing the Negro's gray suit, because the front gaped here and there where the buttons were struggling to hold the jacket together.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What do you kids want?" the man asked gruffly, though the scar gave him a look of pseudo kindliness which was not in \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 keeping with his voice.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We've come to look at the exhibits," Frank said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The museum's closed."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No, it's notl" Joe shot back. "Where'd that old Negro go?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The professor will tell you!" growled the man. "Oh, professor!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Randolph suddenly appeared from be\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hind a glass display case. "Back again, eh?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We're going to finish the tour you interrupted yesterday," Frank said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I repeat," the professor intoned, his voice rising in a crescendo, "this place belongs to me!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's no deed recorded in your name at t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he courthouse!" Frank said evenly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man winced, then he said with a curl to his lips, "They haven't had time to file one yet. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid4016876 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 I }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 let 'em look around. But never again, boys. Keep an eye on things," he told the man, "till I get the deed recorded." With that he stalked out the front door and disappeared down the road.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank, Joe, and Che\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t browsed around the museum. A case full of old sabers intrigued Joe, who examined the ornate handles and felt the keen edges of the blades.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "From the forces of General Rosecrans," stated a card alongside the sabers. Joe was in the midst of a daydream, ima\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 gining the charge of the cavalrymen, when he was interrupted by Chet.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hey, look! Here's an old mess kit."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Always thinking about food," Frank quipped, stepping over to see the odd collection of utensils.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe picked up a battered pewter pan. "This looks as\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  if it had been creased by a bullet."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here's an old canteen," Frank observed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He held the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid10426339 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 metal}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid4016876 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank unscrewed the top and peered inside. "There's som\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ething in this," he whispered. "It looks like a piece of paper."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boy shook the canteen vigorously. Finally a crumpled piece of paper dropped out.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 94 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At the entrance to the museum the guard leaned far back in his chair. Fra\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nk caught the movement out of the corner of his eye.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He's trying to watch us," the boy warned. "Let's go over to the other side of the room."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank put the old canteen down where he had found it and walked to the front of the fireplace, Joe and Chet follo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 wing. Then, very gently, Frank opened the paper.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's a note!" Joe whispered. "What does it say?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We've really found something!" Frank exclaimed in a low tone. "Listen to this!" In guarded tones he read aloud the penciled message:

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I wish it were that easy," F\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rank smiled, as he carefully folded the message. "I'd like to take this along, but it really doesn't belong to us."

moment for Chet to snap a picture of the historical building in which the important clue had been found, Frank drove toward Centerville. Stopping in front of a service station, he asked for gasoline, and requested directions to 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Pleasanton's Bridge.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Pleasanton's Bridge? Never heard of it," replied the attendant.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's in the vicinity of Rocky Run," Frank said, "or at least it ought to be."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I've lived here a long time," said the man as he wiped the windshield, "but I sure never heard of Pleasanton's Bridge."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "More bad luck," Joe said as they drove off. "Now that we've found a good clue, we can't locate the bridge."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys' next call was at\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 Centerville's one-room library. Frank asked the pleasant, gray-haired librarian for a book on local Civil War history. It happened to be a pet subject of hers, and she hurried to find the material.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here," she said, smiling and holding out three volumes, \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"is the complete history of all the fighting around the area. This one's a detailed account of the Battle of Rocky Run. My grandfather was in charge of the field kitchens."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, boy," Chet piped up, "that's the kind of job I'd like."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Thanks very much," Frank said, taking the books. "Perhaps you can help us find what we're looking for."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When he told of their quest for Pleasanton's Bridge, the librarian took off her spectacles and frowned in deep thought.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A Captain Pleasanton was in\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the Battle of Rocky Run," she said. "But I've never heard of a bridge by that name."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Sitting down with the boys, she helped them scan the books, in a vain search for the mysterious bridge.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm sorry," she said finally. "That's the first time I've ever be\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 en stumped on a question about the War Between the States."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet smiled wryly when the boys left the library. "Boy, if people think a needle in a haystack is hard to find, they should try to find a bridge! Sorry, fellows. Guess the mystery of the lost gold
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  ends right here," he said, sighing. "But I've never known you two to give up before."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And you won't now." Frank set his jaw and snapped his fingers. "I have it!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Have what?" Chet asked as he and Joe followed Frank at a brisk jog across the square.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  headed for the courthouse. Joe kept pace, but their stout friend lagged behind, his eye on a light lunch and candy store. Finally he arnbled in.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No," Frank said with a smile. "I'm looking for a bridge. Pleasanton's Bridge."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank's pulse quickened at the man's sudden look of understanding. "Pleasanton's Bridge! Well, son, I hadn't heard menti\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 on of that in many a year, until just a little while ago."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A sinking feeling weighted the Hardys doAvn as they awaited the reply; the kind of sensation that creeps over a person who knows he is going to hear bad news.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're the second\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  fellow to ask me that question in less than an hour," the man said. "You all playing a game?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank assured him they were not, and asked what the other inquirer looked like.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He was a tall, dark man. Stranger to me. Didn't give his name."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Did he have a mustache?" Joe asked excitedly, suspecting Professor Randolph at once.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No. Clean-shaven."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys swallowed hard at this bad turn of events. Thinking they alone had discovered the message in the canteen, they now had to admit some-

enders and leaned back in his chair. Then, with measured words, he told how Pleasanton's Bridge was the military name given a stone and timber span over Rocky Run. It was so named because Captain Pleasanton had been assigned to defend it. A furious battle
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 raged on either side of the span, and when Pleasanton found his position to be untenable, he destroyed the bridge.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then there's nothing left of it?" Joe asked.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys thanked the old man and hurried out. As they got into their car, Chet arrived with a large bag of sandwiches and three bottles of milk.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You found out where it is?" Chet asked incredulously. Then he pointed to a poster on a telegraph pole at the curb. "Civil War Rifle Shoot on the twenty-third," the boy read. "That's tomorrow, fellows. I'd like to see it."

Frank was so engrossed in the immediate problem of racing to the old bridge ahead of the mysterious stranger that he barely heard his friend's comment. Following directions, he drove down the highway, turned off where the man had told

It was necessary for the boys to walk from this spot to the site of Pleasanton's Bridge, because Rocky Run left the road and meandered through the fields and woods, with only the faintest trace of a long-forgotten trail beside it. Frank drove the car behi
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d a clump of trees, then the boys started out, Ivgging the lunch.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This stream must be on the Beauregard Smith plantation," Joe remarked as they went along. "You know, I have a hunch something big is going to break soon in this case."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank was thinking of\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 the more immediate present. Since there had been no evidence of another car in the vicinity, he hoped they would beat the mysterious stranger to the spot where the bandoleer once had been hidden.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Warily the three boys pushed downstream, searching for any \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 sign of an old bridge. There was none. But suddenly at the base of a little rise they came upon a pile of rotted logs.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "An old cabin," Chet said. "Maybe Pleasanton's Bridge was a toll bridge, and the bridge tender lived here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys walked around the pe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rimeter of the
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 102 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ruins. Frank pointed to broken bits of dishes and a crushed kettle half concealed under one of the logs.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Guess this is all that's left of the place, and I don't see a sign of a bridge."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly Joe gave a \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 whoop. "Oh, boy! A rifle!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Some twenty feet ahead lay an antique firing piece, its barrel glinting in the sun. Joe rushed toward it.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't!" Frank's sharp warning stayed his brother's quick motion. "Don't touch that thingl"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This may be a trap!" Frank warned.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're probably right," Joe admitted. "The gun's too shiny to have been here long."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Exactly," Frank replied. Then he added, "Cot a piece of string?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His y\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ounger brother searched his pockets to no avail. "I have an idea," Frank said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He walked into the thicket and ripped a twining vine from an old stump. Tying several pieces together, Frank made a long string from the tendrils. Carefully and without touching\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 the rifle, he tied one end to the stock.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then Frank motioned Joe and Chet to stand off at some distance behind a tree. When all three

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 104 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 boys were concealed, Frank tugged gently on the other end of the vine.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good night!" Chet exclaimed. "The rifle's charged with electricity!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I thought there was something phony about it," Frank said grimly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He tugged on the vine again. Another arc of sparks flew from the rifle, hissing and crackling.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I-I think we'd better get out of here fast!" Chet said, moving back.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly the sparks stopped. Frank felt a gentle release on the rifle as if it had loosened\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  from something. He pulled the weapon toward him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What do you suppose charged it?" Chet asked, wide-eyed, as the old gun finally lay at their feet.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Must have been attached to a battery," Frank ventured as he picked up the rifle gingerly. "Let's look."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e boys cautiously examined the spot where the gun had lain. As they probed the grass with sticks, Joe pointed out a long wire.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This was attached to the rifle!" he exclaimed. "Let's see where it goes!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Knowing that the wire probably was still charged, the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 boys poked along its course with meticulous care.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Snare 105
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Somebody went to an awful lot of trouble to shock us," Joe remarked, as they followed the wire among the near-by trees.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Just beyond, the sight that greeted the boys made them shudder. On the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 other side of the trees was an electric power line. And looped over one of the cables was the wire they were following!

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Boy! What a close shave!" Joe exclaimed. "That rifle could have electrocuted us!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Our enemies apparently will stop at nothing," Frank \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 said grimly. "That trap was laid with professional skill."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Standing far back from the wire, he knocked it from the overhead cable with a stick. It hit the ground, rendered harmless to any other person who might be passing.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This proves one thing to me," Fr\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ank declared. "Pleasanton's Bridge must be near here. Come on, let's find it!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But as if the forces of Nature as well as men were conspiring against the Hardys, a flash of lightning streaked the sky, followed by a deep roll of thunder. In half a minute it \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
grew as dark as night. A moment later a torrent of rain whipped the woodland furiously, accompanied by a heavy wind which tore through the treetops. Rocky Run was almost obscured by the downpour.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 106 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys ducked under some\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  low bushes, hoping the storm would subside. Instead, it grew worse. Lightning traced jagged patterns in the black sky and thunder rocked the ground.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'd better go back," diet shouted. "It's not . . ."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A blinding flash, coming simultaneously with a terri\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ble ripping sound, interrupted the boy.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Watch out!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe pitched himself at Chet, bowling him out of the way of the splintered trunk of a tree a split second before it buried itself in the brush where the boy had been crouching. When Chet regained his wind
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , he said shakily:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Th-thanks, Joe. It's sure not safe here in a storm like this."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Right. Let's go."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With Joe carrying the rifle, the boys made their way through the howling, thrashing woods. They were drenched, and water was squishing over the tops of th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
eir shoes by the time they reached the car and tumbled into the front seat. Frank slammed the door and started the motor. Joe reached back and laid the gun on the floor behind him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When they arrived at General Smith's home, the boys made a mad dash into th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e house and up to their room for a change of clothes. Upon returning
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Snare 107
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 to the first floor, they found the officer in the living room and told him about their recent experience. The brigadier was greatly concerned when he heard the story of the electrified rifle.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Somebody's trying to kill you! Where's that gun?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We left it i\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n the car," Joe said. "I'll get it as soon as the storm's over."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When the boys related the episode of finding the note in the canteen, and showed it to the general, he was astonished. "This is remarkable. Your hunch was correct, boys, about finding a real \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
clue at the museum. Now we're ready for the big push," he declared. "And I'd suggest no time be lost. If I could lay my hands on the fiend who tried to kill you-"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think the rifle may prove to be a good clue," Frank declared. He glanced out the window. "\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It has stopped raining," he said. "I'll get the gun."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Side-stepping puddles of water like a football player in broken-field practice, he ran to the garage. In a minute he was back in the house, his eyes blazing angrily.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The gun's gone!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's disa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ppeared.''
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe could not believe it. He dashed out to the
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 108 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 car and searched himself. Frank, Chet, and the general followed him. The rifle was not in the car.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We were followed!" Frank exclaimed. "What chumps we were not to \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 take it into the house."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Somebody must have wanted that rifle awful bad to come out in the storm to get it," Chet commented.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And that somebody was the man who planted it," Joe said. "Doc Bush or one of his gang. Maybe it was borrowed from someone who wan\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ts to use it in the shoot tomorrow. We'll have to do some investigating there."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're a good marksman, Joe," Chet spoke up. "Why don't you enter the contest?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "With what?" Joe asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 General Smith got up, walked over to a cabinet, and unlocked it. "Here'\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s a suitable rifle," he said. "It belonged to my grandfather. Glad to have you use it, Joe."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe Hardy was thrilled. It took no urging for him to accept. That evening the general gave him pointers on its use, and schooled the boys in the nomenclature of Ci\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 vil War rifles.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "These old muzzle loaders," the officer said, "fired homemade bullets. I have a box of them you can use tomorrow." He produced the pellets and also a mold in which they were made.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Snare 109
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The three boys could hardly wait until the nex\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t morning, which dawned bright and clear, an ideal day for a rifle shoot.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Claude served another delicious Southern breakfast, which included beaten biscuits and fried chicken. Then, taking the general's rifle, the boys and the officer drove to the site of \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
the marksmanship event, which was at the edge of town. The rifle range was laid out in a field alongside the highway.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe got out and registered with the officials, who examined his weapon and approved it. Then he joined his companions, and all walked up t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
o the firing line. On a table lay the prizes. The one marked first prize took the boys' eyes. It was the latest model rifle with a telescopic sight.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly Joe clutched Frank's arm. "There's the stolen gun!" He pointed to a youth holding the antique firi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ng piece.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys spoke quietly to the others, doing their best to conceal the excitement they felt.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This is the time for a showdown," Joe declared.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I agree," the officer said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Me, too," Chet agreed. "But how you going to do it?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'd better put it up to him right now before the meet begins," Frank suggested.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With the general following them, the boys strode
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 110 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 over to where the fellow was standing. Joe confronted him.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "S\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ays who?" The youth stared defiantly as a crowd gathered, sensing a fracas.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We all say so!" Frank said firmly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The youth lowered the rifle menacingly until it was pointing directly at Frank.

Joe sent shot after shot ripping into the target. Once he glanced at the youth, standing beside him. His opponent remained calm and expressionless, firing quickly after aiming.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A sudden silence told the onlookers the marksmen had finished. The judges hurri\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed forward to examine the targets.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank was sorry to learn this. If, by some chance, the guard were spying on the boys, he might have picked up some \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 useful information.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I have big news of my own," Frank said. "Let's go back to Joe."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He hurried to where his brother was reclining. General Smith was sitting on a tree stump alongside him.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm going to ask him where he comes from," Frank said\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , strolling off in the direction of the youth.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet followed eagerly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Nice shooting," Frank commented, walking up to the young man. He got only a cold stare. "I hear you're not from town. Where do you hail from?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What business is it of yours?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Just curi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ous," Frank replied.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At once the youth's expression became hard. A frown creased his forehead, suddenly making him look much older. His eyes darted through the crowd as if he were looking for someone.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank's eyes followed. Perhaps the marksman was seeking\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  a pal. As the Hardy boy diverted his gaze for a split second, the youth swung the barrel of his rifle.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Duck!" Chet shouted, but not in time.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The rifle caught Frank on the side of the head and he fell to the ground.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A shout\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 went up from the onlookers at the shoot. Chet tried to grab Frank's assailant, but the fellow gave him a stiff arm which sent the stout boy sprawling. Then the stranger whirled around and darted along the fringes of the crowd.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In a second Frank staggered \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 to his feet. Despite the trickle of blood down the side of his cheek, he set off after his adversary. Chet raced behind.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the attacker ran into the woods, Frank was hot on his trail. Suddenly a voice like chilled steel rang out.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Stop where you are!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A long rifle barrel protruded from behind a tree, The marksman kept undercover, but there was little question he was the person they were pursuing.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In a flash Frank hurled himself to the ground,

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 flattening out behind a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 bush for cover. The sharp report of a gun sounded. But it was not from the stranger's weapon. Instead, that menacing gun flew into space. It had been shot out of the youth's hands!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He uttered a cry of pain as the rifle was torn from his grasp. Then he das\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hed off through the brush like a streak of lightning.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Are you all right, Frank?" came a voice behind him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe stepped into view, holding the general's Civil War gun.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Did you do that?" Frank asked in amazement, as he rose from the ground.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Sure did. When \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 I saw you drop, I figured something must be the matter. Then I spotted the gun slicking from behind the tree, so I took a shot at it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good thing you didn't miss," Frank remarked wryly, advancing quickly with his brother toward the place where the gun had\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  fallen. "You saved my life."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank picked up the weapon. His brother's shot had put a dent midway up the barrel, but they recognized the rifle as the one stolen from the car. The youth was out of sight, and pursuit seemed foolish.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A Suspect Disappears 119
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Did you ever find out his name?" Frank asked his brother.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No. But perhaps the general did. He went over to see the judges about him. Here he comes now."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The officer hurried up with the judges of the meet, anxious because of the shot they had heard in th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e woods. With them was a policeman. Joe told of the ambush incident.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That kid won't get away with this!" the policeman declared. "He ought to be thrown in jail. I'll report this to the chief right away. Leave it to us. We'll get him." He hurried off.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 asked who the boy was.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The general answered. "He signed the register as Jimmy somebody, but he scribbled the last name. We couldn't make it out."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Probably did it on purpose," Frank surmised. Suddenly he snapped his fingers and said in a low voice to Gener\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're right!" Joe agreed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of somebody crashing through the bushes. Out burst Chet, his clothes bedraggled and per\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where've you been? Running a marathon?" Joe asked his badly winded friend.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet clearly showed he had exerted himself to capacity. He gasped for breath, and his \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 face was so pale his freckles looked like splotches of measles.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank threxv his arm around the boy's shoulders. "Take it easy, Chet. We can wait."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When he was breathing normally again, Chef swallowed hard and said, "I saw him! I know where he went!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Who?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That guy who socked Frank."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet told how he had seen the stranger flee, had circled the woods, and spotted the fellow coming out of them at the edge of Centerville. "Jimmy" had headed into town. Chet had followed, unobserved.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I ... I saw him run \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 into the hotel," the boy reported. "I peeked in the door and there he was, talking to Professor Randolph."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Jumping cow!" Joe exploded.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I wonder what they're up to?" Frank queried. "Let's go and find out!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, sorry," the boy said, bending over to help the fellow to his feet. "Professor Randolph!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man brushed off his bl\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ack coat, straightened his string tie, and glared at the boys.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Watch where you're going! Do you want to kill somebody?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We don't," Frank spoke up. "But we have an idea somebody you know would like to murder us."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Name's Jimmy," Joe blurted. "He nearly to\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ok a shot at my brother in the woods! Where is he?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The professor stepped back a pace, his eyes narrowing as he observed the general walk up with Chet. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said firmly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I saw you talking to Jimmy right in this lobb\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 y!" Chet declared.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The professor's eyes snapped fire. "I don't know anybody named Jimmy," he said icily. "If you'll step aside, I'll continue on my way."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He hurried out the door into the street.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe you got your wires crossed, Chet, and saw him talking \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 to somebody else," Joe said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 122 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet insisted he was not wrong.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll double check," Frank spoke up. He walked over to the hotel clerk. "Did you see anybody talking to that tall man in the black coat a short time ago?" he ask\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, for about fifteen minutes. He just left."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What did he look like?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The clerk described Jimmy in detail, even mentioning his big eyes and innocent look.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's the one!" Frank exclaimed. "You know his name?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No. Stranger around here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Thanks for the information, anyway," Frank said. Returning to the others, he said, "Chet was right. Come on, Joe, we'll make Randolph talkl"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But Frank was doomed to disappointment. The professor was nowhere to be found. The few people around who were not \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 at the shoot had not noticed him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll have to go to the museum," Joe declared, as the brothers returned to the hotel porch where General Smith stood waiting.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The four of them went into the hotel's washroom where Frank bathed the cut on the side of his h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ead.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank felt they should get to Pleasanton's Bridge without delay. The officer settled the matter.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You fellows continue your search for the gold,"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A Suspect Disappears 123
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he said. "I'll go to the museum to investigate this man Randolph." The officer g\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rinned. "It'll give me a chance to find out how much I've learned from you Hardys about detective work."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was decided the boys would start at once. After a quick lunch at a restaurant, the boys set off once more for Pleasanton's Bridge. Frank drove to th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e new bridge, and parked the car back of a gigantic oak tree, hoping no one would notice it.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Presently they reached the pile of rotting logs that once had been a cabin. Today all was peaceful. Rocky Run gurgled and churned musically around the smooth bould\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ers which tried vainly to check the swift-flowing stream.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's take a rest," Chet suggested. "This heat is killing me."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank remarked this was no place to be caught napping. "The more we keep our eyes open, the better it will be," he said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys went\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 on. It was hardly fifteen minutes later when they knew what the elderly Recorder of Deeds had meant when he said they could not miss the old bridge. Some distance back from the banks of the Rocky Run loomed two stone abutments, one on either side of the 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 tream. They were completely covered with vines and moss.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We've found Pleasanton's Bridge!" Joe shouted.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 124 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 running up to the ancient stoneworks. "Now for the bandoleer!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Was the clue to the lost gold somewhere within the mas\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 sive piles of stone and mortar? Or had someone already found it?
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll have to go over each stone individually," Frank said. "We may as well start on this side of the water."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He began work on one part of the abutment. Chet and Joe took the opposite side. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
The fragrant coolness of the stream and trees was a welcome relief to the perspiring boys, who feverishly examined each rock and crack of mortar in the old structure.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Guess they built this thing to last a million years," Joe commented.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank was too busy \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
to answer. He had found a loose chink and was prying it away with his pocket-knife. Like a thin wedge of pie, the piece of mortar slipped out, leaving just enough room for him to slide his hand into the crevice. His middle finger found a small opening in

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Joe! Chet! Come here!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Find something?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think this stone'll come out," Frank called excitedly. "Help me chip away the rest of the mortar."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Using sharp stones and their pocketknives, the

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 three boys speedily cut away the crumbling cement that held the stones together. Frank inserted his finger into the hole he had found before, and tugged. The stone moved a fraction!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "She's coming!" he shouted.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a sliding, grinding sound the big stone w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 as yanked from the spot where it had reposed for decades. Quickly Frank peered into the gaping hole.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I see it!" he cried hoarsely. "The bandoleer!"

and rotten with age, half worn away from the rusted buckle. But the silver ammunition box was still firmly attached by two rivets. While Joe and Chet looked on excitedly, Frank tried to open the box.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There doesn't seem to be any way to unfasten this thing\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ," he said. "Must be a secret lock on it."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Careful," Frank warned. "Don't break the leather. General Smith will certainly want to keep this."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe handled the bandoleer gingerly, turning the si\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 lver ammunition box over and over in a vain attempt to locate a hasp or tiny hinges.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let me see it," Chet begged, ext\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ending an eager hand.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As Joe gave the bandoleer to his friend, they heard a woman scream. The cry for help that followed came from the woods just ahead of theml
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Someone's in trouble!" Frank cried. "She may need help."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The three boys raced toward the direc\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 tion from which the sound had come. The Hardys soon outdistanced Chet, looking carefully on every side as they ran.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's funny," Frank said. "The voice sounded\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  - Hey, did you hear Chet cry out?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They're heading for the highway!" Frank exclaimed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys saw two men scramble up the embankment to the bridge. A moment later they heard the roar of a motor.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They've got a car!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A black sedan, which had been parked on the other side of the bridge, sped in the direction of Centerville as the boys climbe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d to the road.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll catch 'em!" Frank dashed toward their own car, then let out a cry of despair. "Our tires! They're flat! Those men let the air out of them!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At that moment Chet lumbered up the bank and onto the bridge. "What's the matter?" he asked. "Why didn't you chase those guys?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe told him as he opened the trunk and pulled out a hand pump.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hey\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , a car's coming!" Frank said. He raised his hand and the small vehicle squealed to a stop.

Frank stepped into the car, and the driver continued in the direction in which the black sedan had fled only a few minutes before. Without revealing the details, Frank told the driver the boys had been robbed. Upon hearing this, the

n. Suddenly at a crossroad, Frank's keen eyes spotted the telltale marks of a swerving car.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They turned in here," he said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The driver stopped, backed up, looked at the skid marks, and agreed with Frank.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But," he added, "I must get to Hilton right away. I\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 'm a doctor. Wish I could follow that car, but I have an emergency case."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Then let me off here," Frank said. "And thanks for the lift."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The doctor iped off. Frank examined the marks
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 130 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 of the thieves' car. After noting the d\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
esign of the treads for further identification, he set off along the road at a trot. A mile farther on, he paused again at another crossroad, picked out the right-hand fork, and hurried on.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 After following the tire tracks half a mile, he stopped short. The\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  lines suddenly left the road and slewed off into a thicket.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Entering the woods, he proceeded with caution, to avoid any possible danger of detection. The tracks led into a thick copse, interspersed with scrubby trees. Except for a few birds and a scamperi
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ng squirrel, there was not a sound. Suddenly, under a low-hanging tree, Frank came upon the sedan.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's abandoned," he noted, as he went up to examine the car. "I'll bet it was stolen."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The character of Dr. Bush's gang began to grow clearer on the screen \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 of Frank's imagination. They Were a daring lot, who apparently would stop at nothing to gain their objectives.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank jotted down the license number of the car, then studied the footprints near the sedan. They were hard to follow, as the thieves seemed to h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ave separated at this point. Frank chose the deepest prints, which presently led back to une road. From here they were straight, skirting the old battlefield
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hoax 131
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
of Rocky Run. Then like magic they were gone completely, as if the man had picked up a ride. As Frank stood debating what to do next, he realized that the old museum was off to the right. Had the thieves gone there? He decided to investigate.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll see wha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t's going on anyway," Frank decided. "That professor and the guard sure are phonies."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As Frank walked along, he mulled over the events of the past few hours. He was convinced there might be a tie-in between the man who had grabbed the bandoleer and the pro\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
fessor. This time he would spy on the place, and perhaps learn something important.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank jumped a ditch beside the road and hid behind a tree. After taking a cautious glance at the museum and seeing nobody, he pressed his way along a field fence and made \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
for the rear of the old museum.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Nobody was in sight. The windows were closed and locked, as well as the cellar door. Deciding to risk a look inside the old headquarters, Frank slipped quietly around to the front door. It stood open. The guard was not there
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 . Frank listened. Not a sound. He walked in.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 From somewhere in the building came an indistinct but angry voice. "You fool . . . the secret . . . you bungle everything, Smiley!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 132 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 That voice! Where had Frank heard it?
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I tell\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  you it ain't safe to carry it!" Smiley cried out. "Nobody'd think of lookin' for it among the souvenirs," he declared.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank's head spun. Darting around the room like a swallow locked in a barn, he glanced at all the tables and looked under the large exhi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
bits for the stolen bandoleer. Suddenly his eyes spotted something unusual in the display case where he had picked up the old canteen. A general's cap was tilted at a peculiar angle. Frank lifted it. Underneath lay the silver ammunition box!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In spite of hi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 mself, Frank let out a low whistle as he grasped the box, and tiptoed toward the door.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Just before he reached the end of the room, a section of the floor in front of him raised up without warning. Smiley stepped out of a trap door. Frank side-stepped him n\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
eatly, but the man spotted the ammunition box in the boy's hand.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're not getting away with thatl" Smiley snarled, and lunged toward him.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 frank's fleet-footedness might have gained him freedom from the guard had it not been \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
for a new menace. Someone was running toward the entrance. He knew that if he were to escape it would be only by a luse. Frank's brain worked with electronic speed. He called out the door:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Get him, Joe!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He waited a moment, then turned. Smiley was almost \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
upon him. With head down and arms in front of him, Frank hit the man with the velocity of a fullback plowing through the line. Smiley grunted, reeled, and crashed to the floor.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank bolted through the door, ready for his next opponent. No one was in sight\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , Had the ruse worked?
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 133
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 134 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His long legs fairly flew down the road. He looked back. Someone was following. Frank doubled his pace. His pursuer finally was lost from sight.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank did not slacken his speed until he was half \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 a mile away. Then he settled down to an easy lope, clutching the ammunition box tightly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Presently he came to the highway leading into Centerville. He had not gone far when he heard a car. Apprehension gripped him. Had the enemy caught up with him?
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 id behind a hedge and waited, his heart pounding like a riveting machine. As the car approached, Frank's spirits gave a leap of joy. It was the Hardys' new coupe!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ''Hi, there!" he called out, stepping into the road.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe stopped so suddenly Chet hit the dashboard. Frank jumped in.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I've got it!" he panted, showing his prize. "Get to the general as fast as you can!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Jumping catfish!" Joe cried, and sent the car racing down the road.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As they drove, Frank told the boys h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ow he had trailed the thieves and seized the precious box.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There's no doubt now Smiley-that's the guard's name-is mixed up in this thing, and maybe the professor," he said. "I wish I could place that other voice in the cellar."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Breaking a Code 135
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Was it\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  one of the kidnapers?" Joe asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't know. But you remember only one of those three men talked."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Maybe the fellow in the cellar was Baby Face," Chet suggested.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank jumped. "Chet, you've got it! It's Baby Face all right without his Southern accent\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ! He }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid4016876 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The-the one who tried to clip you? Say listen, fellows, from here on count me out. Let the police take over. It's their business to run risks and get shot up if they want to, not mine. I-I-why, just think, even if they didn
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 't kill me-"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
"They might starve you to death, you mean." Frank grinned, then became serious. "You've got a point, just the same, Chet. I'm recommending to General Smith that the police investigate the museum and its new owner and his friends."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When the bri\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
gadier heard the story, he lost no time informing the chief of police of the strange doings at the old museum. He did not mention their interest in the missing gold, being of the opinion the gang now had been smoked out and would leave town.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet felt reli\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 eved to think the troublemakers might be arrested, or at least leave the vicinity, but Frank and Joe were of a different opinion. The
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 136 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 missing gold was a big prize. If that was what the men were after, they would not be fri\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ghtened into running away. Probably they would stick around Centerville, but change their point of operation to a more secluded one.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I wasn't much of a detective," General Smith remarked about his own investigation of Professor Randolph. "The museum was r\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
unning the same as ever when I visited it. The old Negro was there and everything was peaceful. I didn't pick up a clue."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe's eyes popped. "Maybe you did pick up a clue," he said. "If Smiley wasn't on guard, he might have been the one who attacked Chet a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nd stole the bandoleer."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
During the conversation, Frank had gone to the kitchen and asked Claude for a jar of silver polish and a cloth. The others followed and watched as he went to work on the ammunition box. In a few minutes the old souvenir, dulled by 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 its long repose in the bridge abutment, shone brightly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why'd you do that?" Chet asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "So I can see any faint lines," Frank said. "Joe, will you get our magnifying glass?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His brother went to the trunk of the car and returned with a special kit the Hard\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ys always carried. From it he took a powerful glass. Frank held the
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Breaking a Code 137
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ammunition box under a bright light and went over it in minute detail.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I think I see the place where you open this," he said at last.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where?" Joe asked, looking over \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 his shoulder.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Right here in the corner." Frank pointed to a tiny circle cleverly worked into one edge of the box. "Now if the spring hasn't rusted," he said, "this ought to do it!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank snapped out the can-opener blade of his knife and carefully pressed the point against the circle. With a sharp click that startled the onlookers, the top of the box sprang open as if by magic.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Bravo!" the general shouted.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What a clever lock!" Joe s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 aid, emitting a low whistle. "No wonder those crooks couldn't open it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank pried a piece of folded parchment paper from the bottom of the box, where it had been pressed down so tightly that at first it had seemed to be part of the ammunition box. The pa\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
per was in perfect condition despite the many years it had lain secreted. Frank handed it to the brigadier.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Just think," Joe said, "the last man to see this was your grandfather, old General Smith!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The officer did not reply. The room became hushed as the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  boys observed the solemn demeanor of his handsome, tanned face. Then he spoke.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 138 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This is strange, very strange indeed," he said. "I suddenly had the feeling that I was standing in my grandfather's place, there in the old h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
eadquarters, when he put this paper back into the ammunition box and made ready for battle."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet gulped and fidgeted. He wanted to know Ivhat was on the paper.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This is a great moment for me," the man went on. "I wonder what the message says."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys tu\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rned their eyes from the officer to a table on which he spread the paper.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Look at that!" Joe exclaimed. "It's in code."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 On the sheet was scrawled a series of numbers and across the face of the message, written diagonally, were the large letters, C S A. As\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 if that were not cryptic enough, two odd designs decorated the bottom of the page at either side. On the left were three muskets, stacked together like a sheaf of wheat. On the right was a queer-looking tree, at the base of which rested a round object.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "W\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hat a puzzler!" Chet said. "It'll take all year to figure this one out."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank thrust his fingers back through his darls hair. Joe knew he was concocting an idea.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'd suggest," said his brother, "that we all sit down separately and work on this. When we h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ave some ideas, we'll get together."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Breaking a Code 139
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Very good," the general said. "Let's make four rough sketches so we can each work on one."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 This was done. Then the boys and the officer, their brows knit in deep thought, pondered the secret in the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ancient message. The room was so quiet that the ticking of the clock sounded like a noisy metronome.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly Chet chuckled and burst out, "I've got it!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 After half an hour of deep concentration, the boy's exclamation came as a blessed relief.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's hear \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 it," Joe said, grinning. "Probably another one of your brain storms."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet spread himself like a peacock. "It's this way," he said, winking at the general. "The C S A stands for 'Can't Stand the Army.' The guns stacked up means they're going to stop fighti\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ng and sit down under that tree and eat ham and eggs. That big round thing's an egg."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The general and the Hardys burst into laughter.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I knew plenty of privates who couldn't stand the army," General Smith said with a smile.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Then Joe asked, "What about the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 numbers?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a wave of his hand, Chet said, "That's just to confuse us!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 When they composed themselves, Frank said:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Chet, I can't agree with all ot your deductions*
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 140 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 but the one about the tree-maybe you've got some thing there!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes," Joe added, "the tree probably marks the spot for something or other. Now let's get back to figuring this out again."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A few minutes later a sudden glow lighted Frank's face. He reached in\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
side his jacket for a pencil, and began to write down figures on a piece of scratch paper. He had barely finished working out a series of letters and numbers when he shouted:

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I took the C S A to mean Confederate States America," he said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I figured that far, too," General Smith remarked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where does that get you?" Chet asked skeptically.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank followed the procedure with the point of his pencil. The\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  numbers on the message were written in four rows: 42236, 12223, 223, and 222123.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The first figure four stands for the fourth letter in Confederate States America," Frank explained, "That's F. The twenty-second letter is I, the third letter is N, and the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 sixth is D."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That spells 'Find,' " Joe said eagerly,

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 142 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Find what?" Chet was still doubtful of the code breaking.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The rest is easy," Frank continued.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He reeled off the other numbers in the sequence; some, one digit at \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
a time, others in pairs. Spelling the letters out as he went, and with the eyes of his onlookers popping in amazement, the boy read the message:

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's a grand piece of code breaking," General Smith complimented. "Army Intelligence coul\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d use you!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Find coin in iron," Chet babbled. "Come on! All there is to do is find some iron with the coin in it!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We have to fathom these other symbols, too," Frank reminded the others. "What do you make of the muskets, the tree, and that round thing, J\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oe?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "My guess would be," his brother replied, "that those symbols tell us where the iron is."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Near some old Civil War muskets," Chet ventured.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Or under a tree," General Smith said. Then he added with a puzzled expression, "That's a queer-looking tree. Don't believe I ever saw one like it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I still think that round thing's an egg," Chet persisted.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Digging for Gold 143
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Looks to me," Joe observed\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 , "as if we're still behind the eight ball so far as finding the treasure is concerned. 'Find coin in iron' can mean a dozen different things."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's right," Frank agreed. "It might mean " that the money is buried in an iron box, or hidden in an iron min\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e, or in an old forge."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet scratched his head. "Where do we go from here? Gosh, I thought this code would lead us right to the hidden gold."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If the gold were concealed in iron," Joe suggested, "it might be in an old blacksmith shop. They had one on the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 plantation, didn't they, General Smith?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes," the officer replied. "Every big plantation had a blacksmith shop. I have an old map here of the Smith place. We'll take a look."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He pulled it from a desk drawer, and the Hardys eagerly scanned it. The map was\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Hardys had to admit he had a good point but still doubted that the gang would be caught easily. Claude, hearing \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
the story, declared he would stay up all night and guard the house against an attack by the thieves. It was finally decided that the boys would stay on watch until one o'clock, then the orderly would take over.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Put your camera down," Frank suggested. "It\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 'll swing against one of those stones and get smashed."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's get at this pile," the younger Hardy suggested, pointing to a heap of crumbling masonry.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In order to avoid a surprise visit by their enemies, General Smith said they would take turns standing guard. He w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ould start.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
The three boys pulled and hauled, removing stone after stone as they delved deeper into the ruins of the old blacksmith shop. General Smith walked around and around the spot, keeping an eye out for Dr. Bush or any of his men. Once he stopped an

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Nevertheless, Chet stuck to the job at hand and the four worked with silent intensity as the sun rose higher and higher. Finally the brigadier called a halt, and the group sat down to eat the lunch Claude had pack

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here's a handle," Frank said an hour later, grasping a woodrn pole that extended out of the ruins.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That must be part of the forge," the general\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  called excitedly. He was standing guard at the moment.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I wish we knew what Dr. Bush looks like," Frank mused. "We may have seen him many times, but all we know is, he has long l\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 egs, carries a black bag, and probably has a number of aliases."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'd like to get a picture of the other naif of him," Chet remarked. "Which reminds me I need some film. I'll run into town after dinner and get some."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Leaving the Hardys and the general mull\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ing over their plan of attack, Chet took the coupe and drove
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Atom Crackers 155
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 to Centerville. He parked in front, of the toxvn's stationery store and went inside. After getting the roll of film he had left there to be developed, he asked for a new one.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nything else?" the wizened little man asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Guess not," Chet replied as he paid the man and glanced around the store in wonder. Everything from jelly beans to furniture cluttered the walls of the establishment. Finally Chet's eyes fell on a string of tin
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 y red balls hanging from a wooden rack.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What are they?" he asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Atom crackers."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Atom crackers? Do you eat 'em?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I should say not," said the shriveled little man dryly. "If you ate those, they'd blow you inside out!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I get it," Chet said, laughing. "\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They're like firecrackers."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Only a hundred times as loud," replied the man. "Want some? Fourth of July'll be here soon."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet beamed as he thought of scaring the Hardys with the powerful atom crackers.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll take a dozen."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The man put twelve of the little\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  red balls in a bag and handed it to Chet. As the boy went &tit the door, the shopkeeper warned him to run away quickly after he lighted the fuse.

gued by the thought of setting off an atom cracker, Chet reached into the bag and pulled one out as soon as he reached the sidewalk. Had he noticed that he stood directly across the street from the Centerville Police Station, Chet would have thought twice
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 before he struck the match in his hand.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But Chet, oblivious to everything but the red atom cracker, grinned. He lit the fuse and hopped back, at the same time lifting his hands to his ears. As he did, the bag slipped from his fingers. The atom crackers lan

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In a trice Centerville shook to the explosion of the atom crackers, which sounded like a bombardment. Che\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh! Oh!" Chet moaned, seeing people pop their heads out cf doors and windows.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The exclamatio\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n was hardly off his lips when three policemen came storming from the station house. All were armed with tommy guns and pistols.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Atom Crackers 157
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet's jaw dropped when they rushed at him. "Don't shooU" he begged, his face the picture of abject misery. "\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 I didn't mean to do it!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're the critter, eh?" shouted one of the policemen. "Trying to blow up our town!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They were only atom crackers," Chet pleaded.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The officer did not seem to hear. He grabbed Chet by the arm and marched him into the station house\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
. The other two policemen followed in step, which gave the boy the feeling that he was being ushered to the gallows.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But I didn't mean to do anything," he said with outstretched hands.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Tell that to the chief."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The officers led the boy before the chief, w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 hose desk was perched on a dais at the end of the room.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The chief, a stout man with three distinct chins, leaned forward and looked over his horn-rimmed glasses.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, sir!" Chet sighed in relief.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And now tell me," the chief said, "what's this about a Dr. Bush being a thief?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet did not know what to say. He was sure he already had told more than the Hardys would ha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ve wanted him to. As the youth hesitated to reply, the officer electrified him by saying:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Some woman called here only yesterday and warned us to pick up a Dr. Bush if he came around. She didn't leave her name."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Chet told the chief a similar request had come to the Hardys in Bayport. The boys had no proof the doctor was around Centerville but suspected he might be. The officer said the police had checked everyone named Bush in the area, and all had good reputatio
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s. The wanted Dr. Bush must come from another place.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We're looking for him," the chief said. "You boys keep your eyes open too."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We sure will," Chet promised as he left.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet had hardly reached the sidewalk when he came face to face with the Hardys who w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ere out of breath from running.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You all right, Chet?" Frank panted. "We heard a bombardment. What happened? Who started it?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 160 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I did!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe finally got the story straight. There was no doubt now Dr. Bush was in the neighborhood. And who was the woman? The boys decided to\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 discuss the matter at the house. Before going, Joe said:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I want to get some of those atom crackers."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Better not shoot 'em off in town before the Fourth," Chet warned. "The cops don't like it!" Then he added, "I got my pictures."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's see them," Frank \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 said as Chet pulled the packet from his pocket, and held them to view under a street light.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Of the eight snaps the boy had taken, only four were clear enough to print. One showed the old museum, another the ruins of the plantation, and the third a hawk whi\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What's this funny-looking thing?" Joe asked as he examined the fourth print.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Gee, I don't know." Chet scratched his head.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's upside down," Frank remarked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Sniper 161
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Now I see it!" Chet bubbled. "I must have iaken t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 his when I backed into the wellhole. Look, there's the guy who was spying on me!" He pointed to a thick mass of foliage.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're right," Frank agreed. "There are a man's back and shoulders, and part of his legs."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Another half-man," Chet moaned.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Say!" Joe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 \hich\f1 's eyes lit up. "I wonder if this i\'bb\loch\f1  the same man we got a picture of in Bayport?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll find out," Chet said, pulling the duplicate of the stolen print from his pocket.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The legs seem to match," Joe observed. "Now we know he has long legs and high, squar\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e shoulders."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "If I'd only got his face!" Chet groaned.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't worry," Frank said encouragingly. "We have two strikes on Bush now. Next time you'll get his face."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As Chet put all his pictures into the envelope, Joe went across the street to buy some atom crackers. He returned in a few minutes with a bagful.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let me see "em," Chet begged.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "No siree," Joe said, shoving the bag into his pocket.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Upon reaching the house,\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Chet related his experience in town to the general. The officer laughed heartily at the story of the atom crackers but frowned
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 162 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 upon hearing that Bush definitely was around.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Our enemies are closing in on us," he remarked.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  "We must be alert for an attack."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The words were hardly out of his mouth when Claude burst excitedly into the house. He had gone over to his own home after dinner. A caller there had mentioned that a farmer friend of his had two boarders, one of them name
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d Dr. Bush.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll go right out there," Frank said. "Come along, fellows!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Carry on all your maneuvering from the rear," General Smith ordered as they rushed out. He could not accompany the boys because he was waiting for a telephone call from Washington.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
The boys' enthusiasm lasted exactly fifteen minutes-the length of time it took to reach the farmhouse and meet the boarders. Dr. Bush was found to be quite lame, and admitted he had taken the title of doctor while selling patent medicines at county fairs.
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  A disgruntled customer had thrown the "doctor" off his barker's stand and injured him. The other boarder was a mild-mannered farm hand.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Disappointed that their trip had been fruitless, the boys drove toward Centerville. Frank was at the wheel. For some st\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
range reason he decided to take the longer route which passed the old Beaure-gard Smith plantation. Soon they were approach-
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Sniper 163
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ing the overgrown lane which led into the property.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Now I can get a good night's sleep," diet yawned. "No more sleu\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 thing until tomorrow."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Don't be too sure," Frank said, slowing down. "I saw a light flash in there! Let's see what's going on."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As he pulled to the side of the road, Chet grunted and announced he would guard the car while the Hardys went to investigate.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Sure, and fall asleep and be kidnaped." Joe said. "You'd better come along."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet reluctantly agreed and brought up the rear as the boys, unlighted flashlights in hand, walked silently and cautiously toward the spot where Frank had seen the light. The clea\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
r, star-studded sky made it easy for the boys to find their way. When they reached the front of the ruined mansion, Chet flopped down on a granite steppingstone. No light was visible, but there were muffled sounds.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Somebody's digging!" Joe whispered. "Let\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 's get 'em!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'd better wait here awhile," Frank advised. "Nobody can see us, and we may be able to pick up some useful information."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys strained their ears. A thud sounded emptily in the distance. Then another.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly Chet. sneezed. The thuds st\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 opped.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Quick! Move to another place!" Frank ordered. "They've spotted us!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As he grabbed Chet by the arm and pulled him from his perch on the steppingstone, a flash winked in the distance and the eerie whine of a ricochet\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ing bullet shattered the stillness.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'm shot!" Chet cried out.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Apprehension gripped the boys. Had their friend been badly wounded? Forgetting all other problems, they carried Chet to a safe distance and laid him on the ground. Frank, using his body to shield the beam of the flashlight, bent low to examine the wound. 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  splinter of stone protruded from the boy's leg.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Thank goodness it's no worse," he said hoarsely. "A piece of the steppingstone hit you, Chet, not the bullet. I'm going to pull it out."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet gritted his teeth as Frank pressed the wound on both sides until\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  the blood oozed out, then bandaged it with a clean handkerchief.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the meantime, Joe had put his ear to the ground. Receding footsteps told him there were at least two enemies. Then dull thuds made it evident they had gone back to their work. When Chet h\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ad been taken care of, Joe said to Frank:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Come on! Let's find that guy who shot him!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Right! Stay here till we get back, Chet."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The Sniper 165
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But they're armed!" Chet argued. "You haven't got a chance against them!"

g the bizarre scene before them. The two men, their backs toward the boys, were stooping down in a hole dug along an inside cellar wall of the house.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Their talk now was excited. "It's a safe, Hank!" said Baby Face.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Jumping cow!" Joe whispered to his broth\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 er. "If they've found the gold, we're out of luck!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys backed away and held a hurried consultation. It was decided they had better try to stop the crooks from opening the safe rather than go for the police.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But how?" Frank pondered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I've got it!" J\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 oe said softly. "The atom crackers!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank immediately grasped his brother's idea. "We'll scare 'em off! Careful, Joe. If they see the match light, we're sunk."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe lobbed the cracker. Baby Face reached for his rifle. As he did, a second explosion burst at his heels. His hand never touched the gun!

As if to help the men on their way, a third atom cracker burst behind them, filling the night with a thousand reverberations. It was the boys' intention to follow and try to nab at least one of the men, but both started shooting over their shoulders

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank reminded his\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  brother of the distance to their automobile and the fact that Chet was alone, his leg injured.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Charred Papers 169
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'd say we ought to have a look at that safe before Baby Face decides to return with reinforcements."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're right," Joe agreed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Before inv\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
estigating the pit, the Hardys reported to Chet, who was in a near-panic because of the shooting. Relieved to see his friends safe, the boy declared he could limp with little pain and insisted upon going to the pit and watching.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This sure is an old safe,"\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Frank declared, as he climbed down into the hole and examined the large, rusted object with its old-fashioned dial.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Excitedly the boys looked around for tools the crooks might have left so they could open the safe, but found nothing but two spades, which \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 were of no help.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Tell you what," Chet spoke up. "You fellows stay here. I'll go tell General Smith what happened. He'll probably want to come out here."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good idea," Frank said. "You stay home and take care of that leg."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet did not reply, but he was pla\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
nning to do that very thing. His leg was swelling and ached badly. When he reached the car, Chet gave a couple of blasts on the horn to let the Hardys know he had reached it safely, then drove off.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe figured that the general would arrive by ele\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ven o'clock, but hour after hour went

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 by and he did not come. Had Chet been waylaid?
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Finally the boys could stand the suspense no longer. Both started for the road. Reaching it, they turned toward Centerville. At this mome\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
nt a car came along. Ducking behind some bushes, they let it go past without hailing the driver. There must be no more mishaps tonight!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's our car," Frank whispered. "But I couldn't see who was in it."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I couldn't, either," his brother said. "Look, it's turning into the lane!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys followed on a run. The condition of the overgrown road was so bad that the car had to crawl along, with the result the brothers easily caught up to it. General Smith was a\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
t the wheel. No one was with him. When he stopped, Frank opened the door.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We were worried about you, sir," he said. "Is Chet all right?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes. But he reached home with an empty gas tank. What a time I had getting some at this hour of the night! Well, let'\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s get to work. I understand we may solve the mystery."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the back of the car were a crowbar, sledge hammer, file, and blowtorch which General Smith had borrowed from the garageman who had sold him the gasoline. The boys lugged them to the pit,

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 and pointed out the safe, which had been craftily concealed in the wall of the house.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's not going to be easy to open this," the officer said, as he stood in front of it. "And the noise may attract attention."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The general ordered Frank to stand \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
guard, while he and Joe worked. Fifteen minutes later, the brothers exchanged places. The blowtorch had failed to make a hole, but Frank thought they might crack through the hot iron.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Will you hold this chisel at the edge of the dial. General Smith, while\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  I swing the sledge hammer?" he asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The brigadier held the chisel unflinchingly while Frank, his sure eye and sturdy arms guiding the heavy tool, hit one crashing blow after another. The steel dial gave way grudgingly, but finally, with a mighty stroke,
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  Frank knocked it off the rusty safe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a little prying, the bolt came loose and Franfc pulled on the door. It creaked open. He half expected a cascade of gold to tumble into his hands, but instead only a bundle of charred papers greeted his eyes!
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 After\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  recovering from his disappointment Frank investigated the safe further.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here's a book," he said, reaching far back into
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 172 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the safe. He opened the book and flipped its pages. "A diary!" he exclaimed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's scorched," Genera\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 l Smith said. "Probably from the heat of the fire which destroyed this building."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank hastily read the entries in the old book which recorded the daily happenings on the plantation. When it mentioned the advance of the enemy army, the entries became ters\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e. Some day's events were listed in only a sentence or two. Finally, the last entry in the old diary said simply:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Despairing, have taken cannon balls to tunnel. Sent message to Smith."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank whistled. "What a clue! Joe, come herel" he cried out.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "First an\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  arsenal. Now a tunnel," General Smith said. "This is getting more baffling as we go along."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The arsenal might be a tunnel," Joe reasoned, when the notation was read to him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "1 have an idea," Frank declared, "that the bank's gold, the Smith treasure, and \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
a load of old cannon balls are lying side by side in some secret tunnel. Now we've got to start some real digging."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The sooner the better," said Joe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll get a couple of laborers to help us," General Smith offered, "and we'll dig this place up till we f\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ind that tunnel!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Charred Papers 173
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The eastern sky was faintly pink as the group gathered up the papers and set off for ihe car. Back home they bathed, ate, and caught a few hours sleep. Then the general made some telephone calls to arrange for two work
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 men in Centerville to help with the digging on the plantation.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet, who was the last one awake, was agog over the news. Though his leg was stiff and sore, he insisted upon going with the group to hunt for the tunnel.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Directly after breakfast, they set out\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  for town to pick up the two workmen. On the way the Hardys asked the officer where he thought the tunnel was likely to be.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I imagine it led from the cellar of the mansion to one of the other buildings. Or it might have been an underground entrance for sl\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 aves coming to the house."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "In that case, the opening would have been somewhere in a garden," Frank mused.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A few minutes later they picked up the laborers and drove to the old plantation.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I want you to dig in the ruins of this mansion," the general told t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he men. "We think there may be an old tunnel here somewhere."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The laborers plied picks and shovels, and the boys pitched in to aid in the stubborn task. Together

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hand me a crowbar!" he called up to Chet, who \bullet was sitting on a pile of stones watching the work.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 His friend let down the long bar. Joe battered the bricks at his feet. Suddenly they caved in and the crowbar plopped into a \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 deep hole.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the opening he had made in the earth was large enough for Joe to slip through. He beamed his flashlight below. Definitely there was an underground passageway.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Okay," Joe called hollowly in the vault below. "I've hit bottom. It's solid."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What do you see?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe flashed a beam around the moss-cove\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 red walls of the tunnel.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Nothing here," he called. "But I'll find out where it goes."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In a moment he too was in the tunnel. The boys turned left and walked gingerly in the bricked passageway\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 toward what once had been the opening into the cellar of the mansion. The entrance was sealed up by a heap of stones which apparently had fallen down from the old foundation.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This is as far as we go in this direction," Joe said. "Let's find the exit."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Picking their way along the dark tunnel, the boys walked nearly two hundred feet. There was not a sign of any gold or any cannon balls. Presently the passageway started uphill.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here's a dead end," Frank said as they came to a halt before a mound of earth.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Must lead somewhere," Joe said. "I'm going to give it a kick." He sent his foot thudding into the soft dirt. "Look! I see daylight!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe's kick had opened up a slight fissure in the earthwork thrown up at the end of the tunnel.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I'll bet I could crash ri\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ght through that!" Frank exclaimed. "It doesn't look too thick."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He stood back a few feet, then ran forward, twisting around so that his shoulder hit the dirt wall with a solid impact. The end of the tunnel gave way and Frank went sprawling on the grass ou\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
tside.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe quickly followed. When the boys' eyes became accustomed to the sunlight, they realized they
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A Prisoner 177
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 were at the foot of a little terrace in back of the ruins.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "This knoll probably was built just to conceal the opening to that tunnel," Fra\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 nk remarked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And it's concealing something else," Joe whispered excitedly. "Frank! Look at that guyl Where've we seen him before?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank followed his brother's gaze to a figure crouched behind a tree observing every move of the boys' companions. He was th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 in, and had a stubbly, gray beard.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Joe," Frank said in an excited whisper, "he's the guy who gave us phony directions to the museum."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's get him!" Joe cried.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He leaped toward the man, but in his haste stepped on a twig, which snapped with the sound of\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 a revolver shot. The watcher looked around. When he saw Frank and Joe in pursuit, the man took to his heels like a flash.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Hearing the sound of flying feet, the others at the ruins turned in surprise to see the Hardys racing after a stranger.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How the dick\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ens did they get out of that tunnel?" Chet spluttered.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the laborers watched openmouthed, Frank and Joe sped after the fugitive, who seemed to be follow-
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 178 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ing a familiar route. Though a swift runner, he was no match for t\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 he Hardys. In a few minutes they overtook him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Lemme go!" he cried loudly as the boys held on to him. "I ain't done nuthin'!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Why were you spying on us?" Frank demanded.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "None o' your business what I do for the pro-" The man caught himself and refused to\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  say another word.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Pro?" Frank thought. "Could he mean professor?" There was one man in the gang whose name they had heard as Hank. On a hunch Frank said, "Better talk, Hank!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank's deduction evidently had been correct. A wild look came into their priso\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ner's eyes. He made a desperate effort to escape, but the Hardys held him firmly, and ordered the man to precede them back to the ruins.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 General Smith met the trio a distance away from the laborers. "Brought in a prisoner, eh?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank whispered in the briga\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 dier's ear where they had seen him before. "I'm sure he's one of the gang. He was watching us work."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The officer tried to make the man talk, but it was useless. He decided to turn the fellow over to the police at once. Since the Ha\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
rdys wanted to investigate the tunnel farther, they remained at the
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A Prisoner 179
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 spot. Chet went along to Centerville as custodian of the prisoner.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank and Joe looked carefully at every brick in the old tunnel, but it was as bare of any treasure as a v\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 illage sacked by an invading army.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It's evident this isn't the tunnel Beaurcgard Smith meant," Joe said at last.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 While the boys waited for General Smith, they discussed the mystery from every angle. Perhaps now they would get a break, if the prisoner woul\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
d confess. But once more luck was against them. The man, a stranger to the area, refused to divulge even his name, General Smith reported upon his return.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Just the same, I think he's one of the Bush gang," Joe declared.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't like Bush's silence," Fran\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 k spoke up. "It's kind of ominous, like a snake. I think we ought to checkmate him."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Good idea," the general agreed. "But how?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank mulled over the problem.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The man we captured seemed to be heading for some spot. Perhaps Bush and his gang have a hide-o\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ut right under our noses."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "It would be mighty hard to ferret them out," the general said. "They're probably in some secluded place where they'd have the draw on us.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 180 The Secret of the Lost Tunnel
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 If they're in the timberland, it would take an arm, of m\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 en to beat the bush."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Unless we got high enough to look down on 'em," Frank suggested.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "That's it!" Joe was excited. "We'll fly over the woods."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The noise of a plane would warn them to duck," the officer reasoned.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We won't use a plane," Frank declared. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll get a blimp. We can shut off the motor and drift around. Is there an airport near here, General Smith?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Yes, a big one about twenty miles from Rocky Run. Why don't you do it this afternoon? I think there's been enough gold hunting for one day."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Whe\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n they arrived home, Chet handed the Hardys a telegram. It said:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 GOOD CLUE BABY. WEST COAST SLIPPERY. DOWN SOON. DAD.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet grinned. "Gee, that sounds funny. I suppose it's in code."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Neither he nor the general could make out the message, so Frank interprete\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d. "Baby Face is a slippery customer, probably from the West Coast."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Wow!" Chet cried. "No wonder he's handy with a gun!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 A Prisoner 181
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 General Smith looked very serious. "You boys have done mighty well on this case, and have one prisoner. How about call\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ing it quits? With the material you've already gathered, your dad should solve this mystery pronto."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe frowned. "That's just it, sir. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f1\fs24\insrsid4016876 \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 We }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs24 \ltrch\fcs0 \f1\fs24\insrsid4016876

Didn't know the younger generation had so much detective ability. We'll get that blimp today. Call up, and make arrangements, Frank."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boy contacted the airfield and talked with a young pilot who operated a blimp for advertising purposes. Most of his wo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 rk was at night, so he readily agreed to the day job.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 At four o'clock Frank, Joe, and Chet arrived at the airfield. By arrangement, General Smith was to post himself at the old plantation. If the boys found the location of Bush's hide-out, they were to fly
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  over the plantation and drop a message to the officer. He, in turn, was to get the local police to assist in the roundup of the criminals.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As they neared the airport building, Chet burst out, "Just the right kind of day for pictures. Maybe I can take some\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  good ones from the blimp and sell them to a newspaper."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The blimp nestled alongside its hangar like a giant sausage. A young man came out the door as Frank parked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Got here in good time." He smiled at the boys, and intro\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 duced himself as Tom Crandall.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank explained his mission, saying they were going to look for a group of men believed to be in the woods near the old plantation.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "We'll go up right away," Crandall said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He climbed a steel ladder into the control car of th\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
e blimp. The boys followed. Crandall started the motor, the propeller raced to life, and the big craft lugged at the lines which held it to the ground.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Okay, let "er go!" The pilot waved to two ground assistants, who released the lines, and the blimp rose\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  into the air.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank sat in a bucket seat next to the pilot, with Chet and Joe directly behind. As the blimp glided over the irectops, Frank watched the pilot as he manipulated the controls.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where did you learn to fly these things?" Frank asked him.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Navy\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 ." He grinned boyishly, turning his head to address Frank. "We'll crisscross the area. Tell me when we get there."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It did not take the craft long to arrive over the old plantation, although Frank had asked that they

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Here's the place," Frank said, taking in the area with a sweep of his hand. "Go a mile or so north, then back again. Will you shut off the motor when we get over the middle of \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 the woods?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Sure."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys' eyes were glued to the windows for a possible glimpse of anybody in the secluded area below. Chet fussed with his camera, getting the proper lens opening, then squinted down at the scene.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly Frank cried out, "Look! There\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 's smoke over there!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Far ahead, and apparently rising from a clearing, curled a lazy wisp of smoke. Without being told, the pilot shut off his motors.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Somebody's down there, sure as shootin'. We'll pass right over them."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Tense with excitement, the boys w\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 aited for the blimp to drift slowly above the spot from which the smoke was rising.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Can you bring her lower?" Frank asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The pilot nodded, then manipulated the tail of the blimp so that it nosed down. Barely above the treetops, he leveled off again. The\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  smoke was

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Three men were huddled ar\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ound a campfire, evidently preparing a meal. They were faced away from the blimp, so that they could neither be seen directly by the boys nor could they see the blimp bearing down upon them.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The shutter of Chet's camera clicked and clicked again. Suddenly,\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 one of the men who rose to get a another piece of wood for the fire, caught a glimpse of the big blimp out of the corner of his eye. He let out a yell that carried to the soaring aircraft.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The two other men gave a start, whipped out handkerchiefs to cover\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  their faces, and dashed into the bushes. But not before diet had snapped another picture.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What do you want to do now?" asked the pilot.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hurry back to the plantation," Frank said. "We'll drop a note to General Smith."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 With a roar, the motors started agai\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 n and the blimp picked up altitude. But as it did, one of the men on the ground ran into the clearing with a rifle.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "He's going to shoot!" Joe shouted.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Little harm if he punctures the bag," the pilot said calmly. "Helium won't burn."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "But suppose-"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank'\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 s remark was cut short as the rifle spoke and

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Immediately Crandall tried to coax it back to its normal, pulsating drone, but his feverish manipulatio\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "There." Crandall p\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ointed to a storage tank toward which the red tongues of flame were licking. He bent over a locker on the side of the car. Reaching inside, Crandall pulled out a wire contraption.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Lucky we have a Jacob's ladder," the pilot said. He slid back the outer doo\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 r and attached one end of the ladder to specially built hooks in the floor. "Climb down while I bring her lower."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 To hasten the descent, Crandall reached up and turned a big valve.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A long-distance call came in for you, sir," he reported. "Very poor connection, but the telephone company said the party would call again about twelve.\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 It's very important, and will you please be there."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 As the Hardy boys drove off, they wondered if the call might have anything to do with their case. But the thought was driven from their minds as they eagerly talked about the clue of the Franklin tree wh

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 In the meantime, Chet, to while away the time, walked around the town, had an ice-cream soda, and bought some scenic cards of Centerville to send home. At quarter to twelve his pictures were ready.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They're very interesting, son," the shopkeeper remarked. \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Where'd you ever snap 'em from?"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 between ten and twelve o'clock, Frank and Joe covered a lot of ground. They hid the car in a grove of trees, then started their search along the north bank of Rocky Run, the side which \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
was nearest the plantation buildings.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Suppose you look for signs of a tunnel along the shore, Joe," his brother suggested. "I'll keep my eyes open for Franklin trees, or other clues a little distance from the water."

shovel and a spade. Every little crevice among the rocks, every depression in the ground was carefully probed. When an old stone fence indicated they had come to the end of the plantation, Frank and Joe crossed the shallow stream and started back along th

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly Joe became suspicious of a round stone near the water's edge. He called his brother's attention to it.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't believe that rock just happened to be so round," he said. "I'm going to take a l\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe dug deep into the soft ground beneath the stone. Suddenly he stopped.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Frank, I've hit something!" He tapped the\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  object. "It's wooden."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He and Frank scraped the earth from around the obstacle. Then both halted and looked at each other.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A soldier's grave," Frank said solemnly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Bingham's? The spy?" Joe suggested.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank shook his head. "I think not. This rock marked \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 C S A is probably the headstone for an unknown soldier of the Confederate Army."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Joe reverently started to push the dirt back into the hole. "We won't disturb him."

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 and every inch of ground until their necks\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
 ached. Finally Frank called a halt. He went to the brink of the stream, bent down, and splashed his face with the cool water. The refreshing pause must have sharpened his senses, for, taking in a deep draught of woodland air, he remarked:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Smell that swee\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 t honeysuckle?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Honeysuckle?" Joe repeated. Suddenly his eyes lighted with imagination. "Maybe it's from the blossoms of the Franklin tree!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Joe, you're a whiz. Only I didn't find any Franklin trees."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's look on the other side of the stream," Joe sug\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 gested excitedly.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 They crossed the rapidly swirling water and pressed several yards into the woods. Suddenly Frank spotted a flowering tree.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Follow me!" he cried, scrambling through the brush.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 He and Joe gazed at the beautiful tree, whose fragrance scente\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 d the woodland. There were no others around like it.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The only one left of Beauregard Smith's favorite trees," Frank murmured in awe.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Let's not just stand gaping at it," Joe said. "We've got to find the tunnel!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Hey, look at this!" Frank said as he came upon a large mossy mound close to the stream. Opening his knife, the boy peeled off some of the thick g\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The boys furiously continued to dig away the sod, uncovering a brick vaultlike enclosure. They loosed the bricks in the side one by one. Finally they had made an opening large enough to allow entry. Th

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "The lost tunnel! The arsenal!" Joe exulted in a loud voice. "The hidden gold!"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Frank was just as excited as his brother, but he warned Joe not to tell the countrysid\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 e of their discovery, and also not to be disappointed if they drew a blank again.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 But Joe already was leaping down the steps, Frank close behind. They were in a musty cavern. Both boys whipped out their flashlights, then halted as if welded together.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Cann\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 on balls!" Frank exclaimed. "A hundred of them. This is the arsenal all right!" The balls were piled in a pyramid in the middle of the cave.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I don't see any gold," Joe said in disappointment, straining his eyes to catch every detail of the place.

The gloomy tunnel was a natural rock cavern which had been enlarged for a storehouse. The brothers ran to the end, about fifty feet ahead. The exit was solidly blocked with stones, bricks, and dirt. There was no evidence the bank's gold and the

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I have a good clue to Dr. Bush, Mr. Hardy."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "What is it?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "A picture I took from a blimp." The boy showed the photograph of a tall man carrying a black bag. "That's \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
Professor Randolph," he explained. "And I think he's Dr. Bush in disguise. Remember the half-picture of him I snapped in Bayport?"
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "You're right! Bush and Randolph-his right name's Skagway-are one and the same! And that black bag contains safe-cracking too\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The speedometer shot to the limit as the taxi sped toward the plantation.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Suddenly Mr. Hardy raised his hand. Sam stopped. Voices s\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 
ounded near them, barely audible above the gurgling of the stream. Through the foliage they could vaguely see three men, who were talking. The trio seemed to be leaning over a hole in the ground.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Using their hands, pieces of flat stone, and Joe's spade which they had found near by, they went to the job like demons to free the Hardy boys. Their father finally crashed through the barrier.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The crooks remained silent. It was not long before three troopers crashed through the woodland to the tunnel. One said news had just come over his car radio that the notorious leader of the bank robbers, posing as 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Dr. Bush and Professor Randolph, had been found hiding in the cellar of the museum. Secreted in the walls was the West Coast loot. The crook had confessed, as well as the prisoner Hank. Hearing this, his henchmen groaned.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The men related their part in the plot to get the Smith gold and keep the Hardys out of the case. Their boss, they said, was married to a woman who used to live in the Centerville area and had told 
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 him the story of the lost gold. She had not known about her husband's activities until recently, thinking he was off on business trips.

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Beauregard's heirs will be\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  able to restore the plantation and can come back here to live. You Hardy boys turned the trick! Fenton, you're the luckiest man in the world to have such sons!"

\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 The detective grinned. "I'm not contradicting you!" He turned to Chet. "Mr. Morton's got a son\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  to be proud of, too. A good photographer."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Chet beamed. "I'll use my camera on our next case."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 It was not the secondhand camera, however, which was to figure in the Hardys' next adventure, "The Wailing Siren Mystery."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "How'd they get the gold inside the c\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 annon balls?" Chet suddenly asked.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "They melted the gold bars in the blacksmith shop," Smith answered. "The melting point is very low, you know. Then they either made balls of it and covered them with the iron shells, or else cast hollow cannon balls first
\hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1  and poured the gold in."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "And plugged up the holes," Chet said.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Right."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Each of the Hardys and their friends lifted one oE the golden cannon balls. As they carried them from the lost tunnel, the groups became jubilant. Halfway to the car, Chet said:
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "I feel so good, I think we ought to have a celebration."
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "With atom crackers?" Frank grinned.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Or one of Claude's dinners?" Joe asked, his eyes twinkling.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 "Oh, boy!" Chet exclaimed.
\par \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 Despite the weight of the cannon ball, he was the first one to reach the \hich\af1\dbch\af31505\loch\f1 coupe. Never before had he gone so many hours without food!
